comment,sentiment
I was so wrong.,1
"""All flash, no substance"" Only get this game if you really, really, really love the trilogy.",-1
The printer itself works great.,1
"While documentary filmmaker Blitz is said to have based this alleged comedy on his own childhood battle with stuttering, you could have fooled me in this highly mean-spirited, ugly and too-proud-of-itself attitude that I immediately disliked it from the get go and the cutesy touches (Hal's creepy friend's parents use musical therapy with a cello and piano recital of the Violent Femmes' ""Blister in The Sun""), the fact NJ (my home state) is once again a one-note joke (and um, shot in BALTIMORE!!!), and namely no likable characters (nope even Hal becomes a real jerk in the long run).",-1
Raymond and his original group are the real masters of his music although the Beau Hunks are a very close second.,1
Until I saw the movie!,-1
The game seems as if it merely copied of Mario Kart DS at parts.,-1
Every family should own a copy of this great CD!,1
"He speaks candidly about his youth, his addictions, and his career, giving much credit to wife Tabitha for her contributions to both his writing and his sanity.",1
"Oh my gosh, and he always is mixing it up, from hi hat to ride cymbal, dang, it's so chopped I don't even know what kind of meat he is flavoring!!!",-1
"I do not have the 2 channel SACD to use for comparison but I do have the regular remastered CD. This mix presents a wildly un-musical, psychedelic=like four channel guitar panning, throwing Carlos' guitar solos all over the place.",-1
"simply, THIS WAS RELEASED, NOT TO REJUVINATE THE COMMUNITY, BUT TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. If ya wanna fly around and blow stuff up like a mongoloid retard, BUY THIS SIM!",-1
"Also, all of the side characters (particularly the mom, Vee, and the teacher) were incredibly flat and stereotypical to me.",-1
"GRAPHICS 4/10 All Gamecube games have exceptionally good graphics, but this sadly will remind you of the chunky, low polygon rate graphics of Nintendo 64. As this was the first Gamecube game I played I thought of selling my Gamecube (but then I played Star Fox Adventures).",-1
Ridiculous stuff.,-1
"But it's remarkable how well Mill's thoughts about the mechanics of the economy, and how they affect the fabric of society, have aged.",1
A good combination of a skilled director with some interesting compositions and his actors having fun in the process (Tomei is a loopy lush in a glorified cameo and Stevens as a degenerate gambler befriended by Dillon).,1
First off the CG (as I expected) is gorgeous to say the least.,1
"IN this game the Opening scene has the normal cutscene graphics as KH, same as the end.",1
It doesn't help that the film has been on the shelf for several year.,-1
But this game is way too long and repetitious.,-1
I'm very fond of his previous work and I really think that he couldn't have played a worse Profion even if he had tried.,-1
"It is still quality though, with a massive slow riff in the middle.",1
It must be one of the best anti shake designs made.,1
Converting this game to the DS could have been a lot simpler and would have given the fans more of what they wanted.,-1
That's a fifth of the whole text!,-1
there is a very high chance that we'll be kill by the boss...,-1
"Though these tests are long, the questions are simplistic and are little like real AP questions.",-1
"Sure he has all the staples of a 'crazy' role: talking to himself, sudden outbursts of near-violent rage, crying himself to sleep etc. but he never allows this to overtake the fact that William was a human being and that this tragic turn of events has him in a stranglehold only fueled by his desire to be free of this ongoing (and possibly self-afflicted) curse.",1
The controls just always feel awkward no matter how much you tweak your key mapping.,-1
"The character models and karts are especially blocky, while the worlds are alright, but have only been slightly touched up from the N64 version.",-1
Two Worlds is crap and any person that thinks differently needs serious mental help.,-1
I like the wired remote w/ volume and bass controls & headphone and line-in jacks.,1
"But everything positive thing about it is completely negated by one thing: ... Cons: When ANY of the four ink cartridges are empty, all functionality is disabled.Scanner will not work unless all ink tanks are at acceptable levels.",-1
"Written and directed by D-Day's real-life wife Rebecca Miller (daughter of acclaimed playwright Arthur), the film has a leisurely paced, lovely-to-look at feel (kudos to cinematographer Ellen Kuras - who collaborated with Miller on Personal Velocity for her beatifically lensed work including such imagery as sun dappling water, a twinkling of an electric storm in a blue-violet twilight and a dazzling full moon on a clear night) as well as a literate outlook on her characters and their interlocking both subtle (a painful look by Day-Lewis to his daughter's deliberate display of losing her virginity to Thaddius) and not-so (a snake slithering loose under the bed during the deflowering – loss of innocence etc.). But make no bones about it she is a gifted storyteller with some nice quirks (Rose's odd/funny/sweet attempted seduction of a highly reluctant yet respectable Rodney is one of the most amusingly warm-hearted displays in cinema of late that feels real).",1
Jessica alba wasn't all that great though.,-1
I am shocked how good the picture is even when the broadband is slow.,1
Neither PalmOne or the merchant will warranty the display.,-1
Buy one of them instead.,-1
FM function allows you to play music on your phone through your car stereo.,1
"""Disappointing"" I love the whole sims 2 series but for me this game was fun at first but got boring after 2 days.",-1
"Second, my favorite feature, the voice commands, frequently just doesn't work.",-1
The gear movements on this heavy duty head are smooth and very precise.,1
I recommend neither.,-1
I haven't seen a bargain like that for a while.,1
"What time they spent redrawing those expressions they could have used to maintain the original grid system format for the DS. A different issue is the gameplay settings: Easy(aka never played a video game in your life), Medium (aka played one rpg), and Hard (aka easy mode on normal rpgs) have disappeared.",-1
You've been warned.,-1
"Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album, artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.",1
"Also, his movements and actions are very slow and he appears to glide when he jumps.",-1
But I must confess that the new album falls fairly flat for me.,-1
I feel bad that there seems to be any comparison to the classic Jerry Lewis but some tread in that territory.,-1
"Never before in my 22 years of film reviewing have I had the experience of having a fellow audience member turn to me as the first end credits began to ask me ""What do you think happens to him?""",1
"Still, Vincentes book is not a cookery-book but on the abstract and generic level and capable of being used in very different enviroments.",1
My advice is to not buy this game for your children.,-1
Yuck!,-1
Problems Encountered: Had one bad one that I had replaced.,-1
And the naked girl....,-1
"Secondly, I found myself distracted by the ham-handed writing quality.",-1
"I think out of hundreds of pics I took while I had it, I thought 3 were really good.",-1
Perhaps Square should attempt to create a new type of battle system that offers more intriguing strategies.,-1
"The rest of the album relies too heavily on multi-tracked vocals, which bring the album's overall appeal down for me.",-1
Blinded By Fear. Under Azure Skies. It deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as these classics.,1
"Sadly, these were the only tracks worth any attention.",-1
The music is horrible and I am not one to even mention the music.,-1
Then read it again.,1
I felt some chapters could have been expanded to include more information.,-1
"Normally, I don't complain about music, but in most games, the tunes are at least halfway decent, and you can continue playing without having to have the game on mute.",-1
"Arguments for design always start at the top (complex systems), which misses the point completely.",-1
The tutorial part of the game actually instructs you to use things like fences as defendable positions.,-1
"It is definitely not the place to start if you're just trying to get into King's X. If you really want to support this band, buy their latest CD, Ogre Tones, which is an excellent, excellent album.",-1
"Basically, you cannot crawl on the ground or go prone, so using dips in the terrain is not too common.",-1
There is so much too do.,1
The distance between save pts is a few town away...,-1
"On top of that, the film has an amateurish quality (a not-very-similar-looking actor plays Rock speaking from the world beyond, sometimes with his image inserted into the frame with the real Rock Hudson).",-1
"The entire first disc is nothing but power ballads, that lack just that, power.",-1
The gameplay is not worthy of anything.,-1
What bothered me most about all of this was that there was no customer service number that I could call.,-1
Did they become smarter?,-1
"Then I read this book, gave its simple plan a try and realized less than two weeks later that my back pain was gone.",1
"obviously just wanted that thrown in there to widen their target market, and make us laugh even harder they added a fat man jumping off a bridge.",-1
"Anyway, as soon as I strapped these things on, I realized that I made a big mistake.",-1
"It's all about the voice, the human beatbox, and the clap.",1
Richard Perlmutter has done it again - this cd is brilliant and has quickly become a beloved cd for our entire family.,1
"Incomparable is really the best word to describe ""Le Fil.""",1
"even after u finish killing a Boss or tournment, u cant even save...",-1
1.5/5 stars.,-1
"but more like a really decent ""TWILIGHT ZONE"" episode.",1
"Well, I first got into this game in a PC Gamer magazine demo-disk....I thought it was fun, and shelled out the $20 dollars for it...I loved every minute of the game!",1
Generally the rewards for playing good are superior to taking an evil option (and sometimes there isn't a clear-cut evil option available at all).,-1
Pros: You already know the great features.,1
The sound and presentation in the game are fantastic.,1
I'd love to read a book written by the author in the format of the preface.,1
- The phone scratches very easily and does not handle being dropped very well.,-1
"From there, there are sure-fire classics from Kim English, De'Lacy, Lovetribe, Bucketheads and Basement Jaxx. Disc two includes some of my personal classics from Njoi, My Friend Sam and after months of trying to find 'Perfect Motion' in it's entirity it ends up on this collection, which I have to take my hat off to HK for.",1
The hardware itself is simple and well designed.,1
8.5/10 Graphics: The graphics almost look lifelike.,1
"Kasdan layers everything with a touch of stinging wit, caustic dialogue, and unbelievable accuracy of how some people truly are so incredibly dense to the matters of the creative process it's a true wonder how the hell they got so far (let alone dressed themselves in the morning and made the effort at a daily life!)",1
You can't aim at anything!,-1
"Also, many of these tracks are just filler or fluff, such as the James Bond Theme remix which is listed on the Amazon track list as: ""9. James Bone Theme - Paul Oakenfold, Norman, Monty"" James Bone Theme is about right.",-1
Stay away from this film like the plague.,-1
Also: don't be fooled; even though this was re-processed for a 3-D release there is practically no 3-D effects at all!,-1
But then I started to pick out all the bad things about it.,-1
"If you like a surreal sound, this is the one for you.",1
"Don't believe the hype, there is no friendly nike online running community.",-1
It just ain't worth it.,-1
"Controls: 10/10 Your usual for a FPS.....You get your regular fire, then a special fire which can make you shoot faster on some guns...you also got your open doors button...then your move buttons...and map...and jump...and so on.",1
look i bought this game one day and with in 2 days i had beaten it 3 times on the hardest difficulty.,-1
What is with Square and having the characters do 9999 damage regularly?,-1
"Guthrie is a lyrical genius, of course.",1
"Their characteristics and attributes are never fully thought out and explained, their powers appearing more as poor imagination rather than weapons that can control the very fabric of the world.",-1
"Unfortunately, the answer is a definitive no. A bland script coupled with a less than engaging plot overshadows its CG and musical flare.",-1
"But with FFL2, the music just is so repetitive, and melancholy, even during the ''happy'' parts of this game.",-1
"My friends love it, my little brother loves it, my parents love it - you will too!",1
The exercises are very basic.,-1
"If you liked Diablo and Titan Quest, I have no doubt you'll like this game.",1
"I would hate to see such a sad effort get enough unintentional support that they allow, let alone recruit BH to write a third book.",-1
The book is disproportionally focused on single and multilayer feedforward networks.,-1
but clunky and slow as hell.,-1
Not only you have the old lock behind the Ryo button but now you have total control over camera movement with the right stick (and you can adjust the speed of it at any time).,1
"3. The much publicised flashing lights in the top for six smart ""internal"" antennas are if you are not going to place the router in a secluded area likely to become an irritant - walking into my darkened study it was at times like seeing a cheap sci-fi effect.",-1
He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves.,-1
"Not every film is a ""10"" but Lord please spare me the 1 thru 3's.",-1
"To wit: veteran scribe Mike Klein (Duchovny giving deadly dead-pan, is a study in noble rot) is desperately trying to get his current project ""The Wexler Chronicles"", a dramedy based in part of his real-life brother's suicide's affect on him, past the pilot stage for the fictitious Panda Network (think CW lite) and the biggest hurdle is vacuous, yet tenaciously 'my way or the highway' Lenny (Weaver, a dry riot), a harpy in a suit, who is not Mike's biggest fan but has her current junior exec Richard McAllister (Gruffudd in a modulated turn of a decent guy in a deceptive business), a Brit late of the BBC, whose come to LA for the network to give a fresh perspective on the new crop of shows for the seasonal line-up.",1
"Overall - 9/10 The Good-Graphics, gameplay, and audio will blow you away.",1
"The re-mastering is good, it is as if the tapes were cleaned with the separation much clearer.",1
":D Anyways, overall this is a great album and Venus Malone has a great voice.",1
This drive is embedded with Western Digital's SmartWare virtual CD that will ALWAYS and FOREVER boot to your Mac computer.,-1
"Okay, my conclusion is this: this camera is a beautifully engineered piece of camera.",1
"a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets, it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana (loud guitars and screaming) with the down-tuned sound of Korn. Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band, which in many respects they are.",-1
"To me, that's one of the most impressive songs BG have written, and that's saying something.",1
don't buy this cd it is a waste of good money,-1
"I mean, are they the only two people in the world who has lost their last baby-tooth?",-1
"Adding fuel to the fire is many turns in this serpentine crime drama that offers about as much suspense as a re-run of any form of ""Law & Order"": Timmer may or may not have been having an affair with the deceased assailant, may or may not know the true identity of the mysterious local kingpin and may or may not be involved in a convoluted scheme involving high-level real estate conspiracies with the aforementioned gangsta.",-1
"It is as manufactured as Britney, Steps 5ive etc, and on the same level musically.",-1
The main characters fail to hold the players interest as well.,-1
"I am thinking, Kik Wear, Sonic 2000, the ones that are bright pink.",-1
"1. Dreadful to set up - the claim about wizard guide was of limited use after setting up the base unit, and I had to get a good friend to spend several hours doing for me.",-1
But it's cool if you don't have one because then you have a space on every board that does nothing!,-1
Pros: -One of the best RPG series ever of all time for ten pounds.,1
"Needless to say, I feel very let down.",-1
Connected to radio first time with no problems.,1
What ever you were paid it was undeserved.,-1
"Harry is next whisked to sunny LA by Shaw for meet-and-greets to create serious buzz and enlists the unexpected thief a lesson to be a detective with Shaw's for hire gumshoe ""Gay"" Perry (Kilmer equally having a ball and a natural flair for tongue-in-cheek humor), a tougher than he appears homosexual who is reluctant to have the flaky Harry tag-along to get notes for his 'character'.",1
10. Eye on the prize - 5/5stars i give this five stars just because i like the chorus part.,1
"I must say this album really grew on me when I saw the DVD. In my books the music gets a 5 star rating, for sure it was off the chain.",1
"*Welcome to Earth* is a no holes barred pop dance explosion of the romantic strain (more akin to camoflage, depeche mode, and alphaville than moby, prodigy or ministry), but offers up no limp wrists.",1
"A few months after using it, it stopped RAIDing across automatically.",-1
"Then the bosses weren't even historically accurate, and it didn't take a historian to figure that out!",-1
So if you manage to get your hands on it: you just got one of the greatest game ever!,1
Nicky Rogan (Keaton) is facing many cross-roads: his new play is about to premiere on Broadway but Rogan's dilemma is whether to avoid the possible public crucifixion by the notorious critic Steven Schwimmer (Downey in a wonderfully daffy turn) whose perchance for theatricality (he attends his works in masquerade since he has been virtually vilified by all who know him) sharpening his fangs to sink into his baby or watch the drama unfolding of his aforementioned team in the defining moment of baseball.,1
"""Disappointing"" This game ain't as good as the other 2D Sonic games This game is originally for the Sega CD then I found out this game was ported to PC. Even though I rarely play games on my PC I went to order this on EBay then I got it a days later then got around to playing it and I was dissapoint!",-1
"The levels (the same thing over and over) The minions (they always acted the same, like they just had different skins or something) I wouldn't recommend buying this game for someone with experience, but if you just got a gamecube and the price is right ($5 or less) then maybe consider it.",-1
It is way too tight and appears to have not been designed correctly.,-1
"They are very powerful, but everyone has 3 of them, and they balance each other, being the same costs/availability.",1
"Well ""Hyperborea"" is their absolute most haunting an surreal cd ever in my book.",1
BTW- the jitter light is on about 90% of the time with this camera.,-1
"They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad.",-1
"The two leads are funny, fast-witted – like a modern day Hope & Crosby with cool to spare and do the best work they've both done in recent memory.",1
"He goes through the relationships with everyone he meets and his thoughts while reviewing for the race before it's start in Anchorage, Alaska. Paulsen is one of my all time favorite authors and when i read this I was impressed with the emotion, and hysterical hallucinations and I was glad that this book went way over my expectations.",1
"If you loved Tranceport, don't spend your money on this CD. If you loved Bunkka, don't spend your money either.",-1
"-Amazingly pointless, annoying new game mechanics!",-1
Another great book from a great author.,1
The book also fails to explore the relationship between Christopher and his mother even though his bond with his father has been explained well enough.,-1
DVD's and video games play very well on this television.,1
"Finally, for the beginner there are not enough conceptual clues on what is actually going on and it is hard to form any mental model of the underlying processes.",-1
"I could go on and on about this wonderful album, but I won't.",1
"I'm one of the idiots who purchased the deluxe album, and after unwrapping it at home and actually checking out the track listing and such, all of these songs could have DEFINATELY fit onto one album.",-1
I noticed that the unit couldn't recognize the markers from my computer's DVD bookmarks and the AB repeat works horribly.,-1
NG2 doesn't disapoint!,1
Almost every track is amazing and of the sort which one wishes went on for another five minutes.,1
This is NOT the great version I heard!!!,-1
Moby's ill advised exploration of disco gets even worse here.,-1
What a waste of time.,-1
"Having used the CDs and having read the original book, I am also left wondering how ""The Passion of Christ"" a la Mel Gibson could use the Aramaic in order to present such a traditional conservative and violent view of the life and death of Jesus without leading the viewers into a more universal expression of compassion that is so evident in the CDs. Fully recommended",1
I have to remove the battery cover and use the stylus to push the reset button.,-1
"It was obnoxious and corny, and given the circumstances I wouldn't appreciate it...",-1
"I'ma really huge Harvest Moon fan, but this one really disappointed me.",-1
"The starting crushing interplay of bass & drums on Come Back and Stay is nowhere to be heard, the songs simply ""starts"".",-1
Wilco too.,1
Love the drive...,1
"Things get worse: Love Will Tear Us Apart is presented here without the intro on the original album, again it simply ""starts"".",-1
"I wish I hadn't bought this game, and so will you.",-1
Kathy should have at least taken belly dance lessons for a few months from Ansuya before putting out this video-or at least long enough to master the moves she was teaching in this video.,-1
"In KH do you know, when you start, the opening scene looks AWESOME and realistic, and the same for the end?",1
"Have only used it a few times, but I am very pleased with it so far.",1
Replaced it with the Samsung Black/Red to match my TV. It was on sale for 249.00. You get what you pay for.,1
"are so poorly formed as characters that they feel like they're cursory characters in the background, rather then the one's the whole series is based around.",-1
"Rinse, repeat, add water if necessary.",-1
Don't waste your money on this.,-1
Biblical sense.,1
"In this short but insightful novel, Daniel Quinn has created a brand new view of history of mankind.",1
The producers never even feature 1 song where his playing takes control.,-1
"Not spectacular, but a damned fine effort Replay Value - 7/10 The game is quite short, but the hidden artifacts and unlockables (and a time trial mode), allows for many a redo.",1
The beautiful ambiance will make you feel like you're actually in the game.,1
"This DVD is as good as you can buy when it comes to The Smiths. It features a selection of TOTP appearences (which are obviously mimed), some music videos and a strange compilation at the end.",1
It is more like the players are performing on a stage in front of you as opposed to mono's non-dimensionality.,1
"I was in the midst of wondering why I was watching this 3rd rate film when I could have been watching ""Dear John"" instead.",-1
"No, since it's almost a brand-new game, they put so much new features that if you didn't like the old one, you're almost sure to put it in your top ten games after trying it.",-1
It's all just so generic that in 2 weeks I probably won't remember the story anymore and sadly I won't be coming back for the upcoming sequel Demon Hunt.,-1
It's sad that sush an talented artist like him can be manipulated by Record Company that only cares about business (money).,-1
"We have the black cat, lousy score, the Trinity kick, the oracles home (with her in it), cookies, and so on.",-1
He takes examples of Homer and Hamlet but all that Mortimer does is to add lots and lots of padding and useless words to drive his point across.,-1
Gameplay- You'll get the hand of the control really fast and you will finally begin your training as a vampire hunter!,1
"Also, you get more than enough playing time on the battery.",1
DVD should have been much better as well.,-1
This is not fun.,-1
"And after that, she did not even bother to try out anything on my computer.",-1
"And no kiddies, this is not being rebellious.",-1
PS there is a Sudoku widget - so you can play Sudoku on the TV (as I said ealier - don't waste your money).,-1
"not really any replay value and theres only 1 special unlock at the end of the game, after u get that its boring.",-1
I liked this film.,1
"The music has also aged well, Paul Young's voice still gives me goose bumps.",1
My favorite lines: James as Leon to Ford's Deckard in a compromising position: 'Wake up.,1
"As a theatrical movie, I rated this film a 2/10 because it was lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.",-1
I can create play lists in Windows Media Player on my desktop and when I connect the Treo using the USB cable my play lists are automatically synced to the storage card.,1
The design is pretty cool and it is available in a variety of colors.,1
They also skipped many important events like Eragon's back getting slashed open by Durza and him hearing the cripple that is whole in his head.,-1
"I have NEVER seen a belly dancer perform and all of sudden squeal out ""OOOOOooooowwww!""",-1
Yay! -Use of the microphone!,-1
;-) Final analysis: This is beyond a doubt the most boring book I have EVER READ!,-1
It is also nice to enjoy extra features after gameplay.,1
-A horde of sidequests that can distract you from the main story-path for hours on end.,1
"""Almost, but not quite"" The game has a feel to it like CoV (the quest/mission instance's)but with out the quickness and fun.",-1
What a letdown.,-1
"Normally I don't have problems with simple stories, but when combined with the monotony of the quest, you'd think they would have written a better story, to keep you interested.",-1
"Sounds and Music: 7/10 Well, the sound is fantastic!",1
"If there is any background lighting, and the room is dark, the camera's flash does not seem to adequately adjust when the camera is set on automatic, resulting in very dark photos.",-1
"Unfortunately, it takes terrible pictures because of something that would have been so easy for Canon to fix.",-1
"Also, this accrued during normal usage (browsing, music) second, which was mostly the issue, the battery barely last 2 hours!",-1
Why be so snarky towards such easy targets as the vegan starlet?,-1
"10/10 Overall, I don't see why this game got a lower score than the others.",1
it's really great.,1
"My husband and I have read several marriage books over the years...some good, some bad, and one so terrible that Andy actually threw it across the bedroom into the trashcan...but Love and Respect is our favorite, by far.",1
"Whereas in “The Alchemist” I felt I was being lectured by a monotonous professor about how to achieve my “Personal Legend”, by nailing the point into my head over and over.",-1
"This book is recommendable to all if not quit a 'must read' and worthy of referencing current political, business and military discussions.",1
"How deeply disturbing that a book such as this could be published by a respectable publisher, endorsed by anthropologists, and even be nominated for a National Book Award. If Tierney was just honestly presenting evidence of wrongdoing, that would be fine.",-1
"Only Deucalion, Victor's first creation from the Mary Shelly novel that served as inspiration for this updating, is still played straight.",1
"Gameplay : 1/10 As you journey around, you have to battle against other monsters, and buy weapons/armour, like any other game.",-1
"2)this could be a deal-breaker: In the middle of a conversation, even with the cellphone within a few feet of the headset, this Bluetooth sometimes disconnects itself, and the call has reverted back to the cellphone.",-1
And the frame chugs every so often.,-1
proves to be the mark of a first-rate filmmaker.,1
"During the fast portion of the workout, it is almost as if Kathy can't hear the music.",-1
"not that its done it should be very quick, but 2 days???",-1
"Other than the moves she learned from Ansuya, I would venture to say that Kathy doesn't know a doumbek from a zil...or a beledi from a karshlima.",-1
"This, my friends, is one of the best metal songs I've ever heard, period.",1
"And yes, as reviewer Morse also stated, you do have to listen closely for the subtle changes in style and tone(just when you think you are hearing a Celtic sort of sound, it moves on to something else and it challenges you to try and figure it out).",1
The real disappointment here is the build quality.,-1
I give it 3 out of 10 (and that only because Deniro and Norton are two of my personal favorites),-1
"2. The claims about ""up to 500% more wireless coverage"" did not translate into a much improved signal for my remote computers - I only saw very marginal improvement on the prior Netgear router I was using!",-1
"Her ""woo-hoo!""",-1
"When the the main character finally reaches something vaguely interesting, the discovery of an alien corridor, he takes a break from uncovering it to go have a day at the art museum and shopping with his girlfriend.",-1
Most painful is the cartoonish way the military is portrayed in this film.,-1
"This movie skipped 3 whole city's and many, many main characters that were important to the story line.",-1
I also went right through a bench once.,-1
"Control: I can't say they're bad; in fact they're pretty easy to use, if only you could carry more things, but they're really good!",1
"If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?",-1
Very one dimensional.,-1
I think Patricia is simply milking the system on her way to retirement.,-1
"Super quiet soft passages and reasonably rocking loud ones without a hint of tape hiss, it's all here.",1
"Pick up FFA or FFL3 for halfway decent Final Fantasy games on the GB. Final Comments: I was stuck with this game and Mario Golf being my only entertainment on a cross country trip (I lost 4-5 of my GBC/GB games in a hotel room) and every time I tried to stomach through this game, I kept running back to Mario Golf. Please, if you want a good game, get anything but this.",-1
A good beginner's tablet.,1
"Overall, it was a good book.",1
"Both actors give finely tuned turns here with Brosnan in one of his most physically demanding performances with a certain dirt-under-the-fingernails grittiness, sporting a Don Quixote VanDyke and thatch of graying hair, a grizzled wrinkling pre-aged look that suggests his suffering character is damned in the long run.",1
"grainy photos, slow jerky movement.",-1
Spoiler Alert One would think a movie featuring Robert Deniro and Edward Norton would be good.,-1
"I enjoyed reading sections aloud to my wife and more than once getting that ""ah-ha!""",1
"When I heard that the middle section where Paul sings ""Since You've Been Gone...."" is truncated did I realize that this is the single version being used, NOT the original album version.",-1
"The wraithlike incarnation of the man into batsuit avenger is a thing of Gothic beauty (echoing the Tim Burton and Frank Miller conceit) expertly designed by screenwriter David S. Goyer (the ""Blade"" trilogy to name just three successful comic book to screen adaptations) with Nolan flexes the mind, muscle and sardonic humor quintessential to a truly American original hero.",1
"You've seen her many many times before, only the last few times you saw her, she was interesting.",-1
"The maze scene will take you back in time to your old days of playing ""Dungeons and Dragons""...",1

"And on the title track, 'Hyperborea', I could see myself on a barren yet breath-taking frozen landscape.",1
Emphatically one of the year's best films and one that you need to seek out for the performance of the year.,1
Bottom line love Star wars get it.,1
"While I know this is the nature of any magical world, it's overdone to the point of distracting the viewer.",-1
"Considering Palmone's lack of customer support and English as a second language staff, I would not recommend the purchase of this PDA.",-1
It runs on and on again ...It is really boring music.,-1
"Living next to a large body of water I can shoot ducks, tow boats, Osprey, anything else, at distances of 100 yards and even further.",1
It could teach him some basic rules and tricks.,1
Pros: Long range zoom for distance and nature shooting.,1
And I would get a game that's not so easy that a 3 year old can beat it in 3 days.,-1
Do you know who Jeff Chandler is?,-1
The gunshots are...near perfect.....there is even some villains that taunt you during the major killage which you inflict on the fiends....Then the music...Your very great western music!,1
You have now mastered the fighting game.,-1
Just thinking of this film makes my stomach sour.,-1
"which was so very prominent in her ""Walk"" is missing.",-1
He is is no quirkier or more matter-of-fact than half the people I know.,-1
"Also, your diplomatic actions and nice foreign relations may or may not pay off, so it is difficult to figure out a winning strategy.",-1
This is not one of those books you would simply read once and pass on.,1
"This new function is really cool, the game continues while you are not even playing!",1
1.I Realize - 5/5 stars.,1
I found such effects distracting and annoying.,-1
"Don't think this is a true port of the really good SNES game Harvest Moon, because Natsume, the company who created all the HM games, took of the major part of the game: interacting with others.",-1
"Surely you will look for more challenge, if you have played until the fourth year (I didn't) you should be bored by now.",-1
The sound is also a let down because you can hear the enemies uttering similar remarks throughout the game - sometimes giving away their position.,-1
Fans of the mindless hack-'n'-slash might just like this one as a rental.,1
A nice western-cartoon feel!,1
Narrator is impossible to sympathize with; he chased money and worldly success and is now reconsidering.,-1
"The essay questions are acceptable, but instead of explaining different approaches to writing the essay and evaluating the sources (like the Princeton Review) this book simply gives example essays.",-1
Any race can truly beat any race.,1
This means that your equipment will get dusty even if the bag is closed.,-1
The vibration reduction cannot be faulted even at maximum zoom.,1
"President Kennedy used to drink it!""",1

Love RPG's get it.,1
"The superior attitude and preachy tone works against their message, though.",-1
He can distill a century of mind-numbing bench science into a metaphor that his 10-year old can understand and that readers of all ages will appreciate.,1
Most only require the student to know a definition.,-1
"Which leads me to believe that this, and other TJB CD's in Herb Alpert's Signature Series, were mastered to CD directly from the original mixdown album masters that were used to press the original A&M vinyl LP's back in the 1960s (a common practice that was routinly done by the record industry with past album masters during the dawn of the CD era 25 years ago, which magnified the imperfections of analog album masters on CD).",-1
"It's hard to believe this is director Lin's follow-up from his remarkable debut with the indie fave ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" but if you're gonna sell out it could be a lot worse.",-1
The others have been going strong and they don't use much battery power.,1
True these all come from 78 RPM sources but they are as good as it gets.,1
"It is impossible to survive the music, even though there is very little of it, when it happens you will be sorry that you did not mute.",-1
This is the reason that this movie should not have been re-made.,-1
Another thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow!,-1
"Don't forget the Apple choice is a closed system, no real choices beyond Apples product line.",1
Why not just redo Final Fantasy 1? None of the characters talked at all in the original Final Fantasy.,-1
"At best, it sounds like some cleaned up B-Sides. She probably should have worked hard on a few songs rather than not putting very much into all of the songs on this album.",-1
"If you thought PULSE was bad, OOOH just you wait!",-1
"A surprisingly well-written screenplay by Steven Katz (SHADOW OF A VAMPIRE) and newbie Joe Gangemi, the dialogue rings true of the formulaic supernatural yet offers an intriguing premise interpolating Nietzchian thought (eternal recurrence) – the two were students in a philosophy class – and some fine moments of paranoia fueled anxiety for Blunt's heroine (is she in danger with this person or not), and although the 'ghost story' section feels a little rushed it works with the backdrop of the winter storm encroaching.",1
Nor will I buy another in the future out of fear of getting the same results.,-1
"Pretty good story, and if it seems simple, don't worry; you will soon get into it.",1
Cinematographer Alar Kivilo's blue-black schematics make you feel the stinging cold of the Midwest bleakness engulfing the characters' plight.,1

And what's up with the father calling his daughter 'squirt'?,-1
"But no, the instruments don't take center stage.",1
"Dagger just simply exists in this title, and is so predictable, that her story could have been summed up in about 20 minutes of the game.",-1
He runs as if he has been running for 400 miles beforehand.,-1
The best news is: This unit works!,1
"The sound effects are great and accurate, making it seem like you're in a movie (the rip rip rip of the MG42 is what it should be -- alarming).",1
I gave this film a 2/10. A point for the only two good scenes in this film.,-1
"Well first of all she came up with the very original idea of an Imperial Super Weapon. Second, you know how many authors describe the difficulty of creating adversaries to give a worthwhile challenge for a very powerful hero?",-1
"But I hate it since I had to pay 8 bucks for something that should have been a SCI-FI, USA or an ABC movie of the week.",-1
Barely. Soon this game becomes another case with a disc inside collecting dust on your shelf.,-1
"The visuals and firefights seem great as well, grenade explosions look like they should and the flak being fired into the sky by Germans in fields around you makes it very immersive.",1
I don't think it's right for EA to expect people to pay $10 more for less content compared to the past console versions.,-1
"I would never say that this is essential prog material, but hey, for a few bucks you could buy this or buy some of todays musical drivel, I'll go for this Thanks.",1
"Perhaps I'm jaded, but now much of this album sounds pretty silly (as does a lot of the music I proudly own from that era).",-1
The biggest failing is the lack of depth about the AP test or proper strategy.,-1
"MUSIC & SOUND EFFECTS 0/10 The starting music is mute pressing material and when you get into the actual game, it does not change.",-1
"WWF WrestleMania X8's original gameplay engine recreates all the action, excitement and tradition WWF fans have come to love.",1
My pictures did NOT live up to ANY of my expectations.,-1
"This Virtual CD cannot be disabled, unmounted, removed, eradicated, or partitioned away - EVERY!!!!!",-1
Well Black took a self-imposed sabbatical (ie he was considered a pariah and he had a near mental breakdown due to depression) and managed to get his s*%% together to make a fine comeback in this his directorial debut that delivers just what the smart-ass title suggests not so subtly.,1
"Actually, this is the only Neil Finn release that has not been a favorite of mine.",-1
"Eiko is a Relm (FF6) character who takes up too much plot fawning over the sexy Zidane (oooh, monkey tails...), and Amarant is like a dummied down Shadow (FF6).",-1
"That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.",-1
But fall short and aren't justified by argument or stories.,-1
"Of all my purchases, ( that include text-only games ) this is the one that I most regret.",-1
It's like listening to Santana perform and having the bassist playing about 20 feet behind them with his amp turned down really low.,-1
Gameplay The gameplay in battles are weird!!,-1
"Other than these, The wrath of cortex is a very enjoyable platformer, with some great action moments and puzzles to figure out.",1
"If you want a headset for the gym like I do, then stay away from these - unless you have a head the size of Shrek. The ring around the back of your head that connects the earpieces is about 2 full inches from your head/neck.",-1
"Not to mention the link they provided was to the 9650 not the 9550. Finally when I upgraded the firmware and it didn't solve the issue, I was sent to ""level 3"" support.",-1
They do stuff their own way.,1
However in its latest incarnation the answer seems to be repetitive (ie we've seen it before).,-1
I'm using it almost daily and haven't yet gotten over how powerful this point and shoot is.,1
Where you relate and bond with Love Actually you tend to scratch your head wondering what the heck is going on.,-1
"However the film's final moment feels like a cop out and not an entirely believable close to an otherwise unnerving, nasty slice of the American Dream becoming the American Nightmare.",-1
Atrocious!,-1
"And Brian Leary's voice is the perfect accompaniment to it all, pulling it all together like Rain Parade did in their best moments.",1
"Playing through adventure to unlock stuff gets really tedious, as it's LONG. So does event mode.",-1
The WiFi connected to the internet instantly and the bluetooth helped me trannsfer my pictures and videos from my phone onto my computer.,1
I gave this game a 6 for the gameplay because of the lack of features they included in this version of the game versus the Xbox 1 version.,-1
"This is all in a game which claims to let you use ""Real Military Tactics.""",-1
as billionaire heir Bruce Wayne hellbent for vengeance for the murder of his parents which leads him on a journey of redemption from the brutal Asian prison camp after taking a nowhere-to-go downward spiral attempt at crime where he encounters the mysterious Henri Ducard (a suitable Neeson) and the ninja-training from guru of vigilantism Ra's Al Ghul (an imposing Watanabe) laying the foundation to his inner turmoil exploited into an iconic hero to thwart the evil in Gotham. Watching all the jigsaw puzzle pieces interlock from the beginnings of Wayne's brainy conceit of the Batsuit to the Humvian Batmobile are giddy joys for the inner fanboy of every squandered youth.,1
That was nothing but a pu$$y move on their part...,-1

"I honestly can't think of a time when I want to listen to trance and I think to myself ""You know what would be great?",-1
Time Attack is great for short 6 minute play sessions.,1
Great remakes are few and rare.,-1
Not even close.,-1
And to hint that scientists are keeping (or would keep) supernatural explanations secret completely misreads what science is all about.,-1
The power cable (AC adapter) is similarly integrated into the amplifier.,-1
"And I have to call you back on long-distance, and then wait forever to the muzak and then hope that you might authorize a replacement, I asked.",-1
It was a total waste of my money.,-1
"Ghosts, abdominal snow men, Lochness, the story is almost identical to to the first.",-1
It is easy to read and has all the essentials.,1
"We are never 100% certain if in fact he had a daughter but I'd hedge my bets that Kerrigan is too sharp to fool his audience into false beliefs (I recognized one gut-wrenching clue when William mentions to a ticket clerk he lost his daughter on September 11th) particularly Lewis' gentle interplay with the natural born Breslin, a very excellent young actress who also shines in her sad, shy Kira, a child who is suffering as well inside and eventually blossoms into happiness and can see that there is more than meets the eye with William (who's final act has all the suspense of a melodramatic thriller in what the audience fears his truth to become).",1
"Barbara Hambly is no doubt a good writer, but I think she would be better served writing romance novels.",-1
This game could have been prevented.,-1
I have watched two full length movies without rechargeing the battery.,1
"You're not able to search for your friends, sync your email contacts, you get errors when syncing in with facebook and twitter.",-1
Am I asking too much in asking to SOME thought process while developing this film?,-1
"In summary I dislike it immensly, also downloaded the demo for the second one.",-1
"Kudos to the grimy yet clear-eyed cinematography by John Christian Rosenlund, Eve Cauley's earth tone sepias production design and the right-on-the-money period costume design by Tere Duncan giving it a timeless late '50s – early '60s vibe.",1
"It seems I may have used the flash accidentally once or twice (I keep it off) but if I depended on it I might be a little wary of its constant popping up as I'm sure its just a flimsy, plastic rack and pinion mechanism.",-1
"I have PURCHASED every album since 1993, so I feel I speak with some authority when I say that this album is by far the worst yet.",-1
What a disappointment!!,-1
"Although it became soon dated, it sounds today very fresh.",1
"I am upon writting this rewiew, impressed by how much such simple and short text has inspired me to think and how effective so few words can be at presenting such profound and compelling ideas for peace and prosperity.",1
"If all spies looked like her and moved like her, there would be chaos in the world.",1
It actually has a lot of good stuff in it.,1
and I think it is pretty.,1
"I loved the strong, independent main character.",1
I wish everyone could read what they say about the feedlot fattening operations - I think many would be inspired to seek out free range meat.,1
What's the point of that?,-1
"Later trying to decide what to do about this problem, I realized that this was a malfunctioning product and they they should take it back.",-1
"But it's too little, too late.",-1
"Also, it fits perfectly in my collection of ""chill-out"" music.",1
"And one of the greatest lines ever: ""Good gosh how hard can it be?",1
"When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish, menu are slow, text is not skippable.",-1
For the music part the music is pretty weird too.,-1
"It really does, as reviewer Morse put it, take you on a visual journey-you really do feal like you are there.",1
If you have the choice between this and Pokemon then buy Pokemon.,-1
Namely the decision to give Billy a backstory.,-1
5. The screen size is a pleasure.,1
"Try it, give it a shot, and for a few bucks you may find that you've got your back back!",1
I agree with other reviewers who have said that the remote control has small buttons and is confusing to use.,-1
I think/hope I have spotted all the faults.,-1
"I bought this TV off of eBay for $300 in 2006 when the average price was for 800 - 1,000. The picture is excellent as well as the sound.",1
i am very hapy with this cd and i think you will be to.,1
"Since I use reference material often at my work, this is an extreme disappointment...",-1
I like this system much better than junctioning and materia and even espers.,1
i wouldnt really suggest buying it unless ur one of those who pick something up and can play 5 min of it and not play it for a long time.,-1
Usually Bon Jovi cd's are good but this cd was just crap.,-1
And I also find myself running through a lot of people.,-1
"But besides that, the movie was terrible.",-1
"When the actors are speaking I would like to see their faces, so I can understand the dialogue.",-1
"But these aren't the worst complaints I have with AV. Plot wise, AV struggles to develop anything that could resemble an engaging masterpiece.",-1
"Well get this chemical makeup: Stunning and popular star Lara Flynn Boyle overtly titillating us and wearing skimpy outfits even including a bikini(!), Timothy Hutton, habitual scene stealer Oliver Platt during younger and thinner days, superstar Faye Dunaway, and Steven Webber from the TV show ""Wings."" How's that for voltage?",1
"So, she was teaching a ""chest circle"" but she was not doing one.",-1
"WHITE NOISE taps into many other (and better envisioned) sources of the ghostly genre including a score of old ""Twilight Zone""'s, ""POLTERGEIST"", 'THE CHANGELING"", ""AUDREY ROSE"", ""THE SIXTH SENSE"" and ""THE RING"" to name several off the top of my head.",-1
"But the in-depth commentary on the Psalms, the saints, the Church, on liturgy and theology..and especially the people of the monastic world..",-1
The wireless sync for email/calendar/contacts/notes with the desktop works perfectly.,1
"Around the second month I had this phone, the charger broke.",-1
"If you love movie sound tracks, pop remixes, or soft edged dance music, you might enjoy this CD.",1
Gaming grid system is gone.,-1
Be aware that the game will likely crash for you at some point.,-1
"Kudos also to a viscerally uneasy turn by the lush Connor Tracy (late of ""FINAL DESTINATION 2"") as a blind medium in a scene that begs for more screen time development.",1
"Mill's ""Principles"" are required reading for everyone seriously interested in the history of economic thought.",1
The perfectly edited shower scene (the blade never pierces the flesh!),1
The latest pretender to the throne is a horse of another color (and yes the pun is meant to be offensive).,-1
The end result is a lot of bird poop gags and overall bloat (reportedly costing $175 M for the CGI F/X).,-1
"Yeah, you really showed them...",-1
I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track 'Sphynx Lightening'.,1
"I still love ""And Then There Was Silence.""",1
"Multiplayer in both the N64 and DS versions of the game are extremely alike, and are good natured fun with friends.",1
"This book alleges scandalous, hideous misdeeds on the part of distinguished scientists such as Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel. But all of the book's main accusations have been thoroughly refuted, and the only genuine scandal here is the way the author, Patrick Tierney, has fabricated and distorted reality in order to sell some books.",-1
"This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen, and anyone that has read the books will agree with me!",-1
It's amazing that a book written a little more than two decades ago can still be relevant and current.,1
"I understand that she is a beginner, and that she is not a belly dancer.",-1
"Considering the relatively small size of the maps, the graphic detail could have been seriously improved.",-1
It's obvious that she gave very little thought to who the target audience is.,-1
I played the next day and had fun.,1
"Overall the acting is solid and on the money, again with Cheadle and Ejiofor showing deft acting chops with versatility of drama and comedy.",1
It has a lot of rhyming words and some good humor in the story.,1
Looking over the lyric sheet it appears he's written the same song over and over again for three albums.,-1
Mark Haddon's first book puts him in the league with great authors of our time.,1
Her snake arms were stiff and lifeless and she let her arm form collapse on the downward motion of the arms every time.,-1
"Yes, Swain was too old to play Lolita but why, why on earth do they have her acting like a 5-year-old.",-1
"If you want good rides, go to Universal Studios, do not buy this, it just does not cut it.",-1
"Then I tried Best Buy, where I had bought the camera, but they also had no such adapter and no such accessory kit.",-1
"The second installment in the Final Fantasy Legends series, is probably the worst, and later on, becomes physically painful to play.",-1
"I'm butchering the description, but it's really a powerful piece.",1
This computer is amazing!!,1
"Seriously, don't waste your money or your time on this movie like I unfortunately did.",-1
They just come rushing towards you.,-1
It has all of the Koontz humor and quirky dialog.,1
"The marine Brigadier General is the US militaries most honor soldier, having recieved 2 Medals of Honor and 1 Brevet Medal (No longer issued, akin to the Medal of Honor).",1
"It took twenty more minutes for the support rep to get all my information - 20, I kid you not.",-1
It cannot be played at high graphics even with a very high quality PC. I don't think they can even patch the thing to playability because of the graphic issues that may not be fixable.,-1
The only problem I have with anything graphical are some of the transitions between animations in the game...,-1
"Hopefully now it is running I won't need to do that again, and getting the other machines connected will be easier.",-1
* I wanted to see a chapter written by Kevin Vanhoozer.,-1
"Well, let's see...For starters, the pacing of the game is very uneven.",-1
"On the gameplay side, the difficulty settings allow for pretty good challenge between teams.",1
I mean the title alone is so apropos.,-1
"And even the voice acting is well done, with the occasional joke now and then.",1
Some of the things they put in the game to be clever are just stupid.,-1
"The authors observations will give credence to the gutt reaction of many towards war: that their is much lacking in it's purpose, morality and worthiness with hopes that its text will motivate us as a people to raise the bar of restraint and accountability of our elected officals as it relates to war and war profiteering.",1
"The bad - on my Windows XP machine, with not much software installed and generally well-maintained, the software failed to install the drivers properly.",-1
What a hoot!,-1
some units arnet up to scratch however.,-1
"Somewhere between 2005 and now, Koontz decided not to take the whole thing too seriously: What began as a pulpish horror/adventure story with humorous overtones has morphed into a full-blown farce, complete with a naked, dancing troll with a taste for bath soap and interminable scenes filled with wacky patter that would be more at home in a romantic comedy.",-1
"The AI in this game is so strong and deeply complex, that it can actually make you feel stupid, which is probably not good for the gaming masses.",1
Then dump her in the inn (or kill her if you are feeling particularly evil) and go off gallivanting with the Halfing pirate and insane necromancer instead!,1
"I ended up having to manually configure everything just to get the iBook to see the router, then get it on the 'Net, using wires and wireless.",-1
We are still out here and you have ruined the artistic integrity for this game.,-1
Now - i used the included software to run a backup of a roughly 300 gig drive that is relatively full and it took almost 2 days for the 1st image to complete...,-1
Pros: It makes a great coaster for a frothy beverage!!!,-1
"Their reaction to this album was, however, almost identical to mine, close to being boring and not living up to expectations.",-1
"This is one amazingbook about a man (Gary Paulsen) and his experiances with running the Iditarod dog race in Alaska. It goes through his nothing but humorous traing process, and then onto the grueling, tiring, painful race.",1
"Support has head up rectum - after informing them I uninstalled the program but the program never fully uninstalled, I was informed that I must have done something wrong.",-1
To me it was just not original.,-1
"It is NOT a sequel to Starcraft, and it is NOT an AoE rip-off either.",1
If you want to stab someone the knife stays in your hand so you have to pull out your gun again.,-1
"Bento is a smart, convenient database for the non-power user.",1
"The song starts slow and then builds into a great chorus as Williams sings ""Please don't get me wrong, because I'll never let this go, but I can't find the words to tell you I don't wanna be alone, but now I feel like I don't know you"", and then it's right back to the soft guitars and drums.",1
"This is a sub-par album for any band, let alone one as stellar as King's X. As many have already mentioned, it's a modern recording of a bunch of rehashed throw-away tunes that didn't make it onto their first album, Out of the Silent Planet. They were put in the circular file then, and that's honestly where they should have stayed.",-1
"So, anyway, the bass line sounds like it is so chromatic, it is so inside, and it completely matches with the melody.",-1
A lot of humor and interesting quests if you take time to read them.,1
9. Table For two - 5/5stars Nice feel to the music.,1
"However, I did like the magic system with the witches, warlocks and mages all having different functions in the world, and how there are numerous classes and castes within each magical house.",1
Plenty of force powers and items to use.,1
"Additionally, the rewind/fast forward features for videotapes are quite rapid.",1
"She has no natural rhythm, and frequently gets off beat with the music.",-1
I wish Swain would have remembered what it was like at that age instead of trying to over compensate for being too old by acting childish but maybe that is what the script required her to do.,-1
Good graphics.,1
"When I called their support 5, yes, 5 times to solve just upgrading the firmware, they told me first that the iso was fine, then to use a boot diskette, then to use the iso.",-1
"It also used the pleasantly Awful blue screen, where the backdrop...",-1
well looked as fake as it was....,-1
Graphics - 9.5/10 Beautiful.,1
Even the remix of Southern Sun found in this collection is inferior to the original.,-1
It also puzzles me about the character selection because nobody has high speed or anything so there is really no need.,-1
"IFC produced indie gem with great, subtle acting and impressive novella-type narrative with characters as the film's focal point: to wit, former idealized hippie Jack Slavin (a never been better Daniel Day-Lewis) who lives with his tween daughter Rose (bewitched, beguiled and bewildered newcomer Camilla Belle) in their shared abandoned commune he created with her mother (who left them when she was very young) on a small remote e 'island off the East Coast of the United States' (as the beginning title card tells us over the amusing ""I Put A Spell On You"" by Creedence Clearwater Revival appropriately setting the tone).",1
"Well, I think this band has some pretty fat salt licks, because, I don't know, it's pretty salty.",1
"Unless you really adored the original FFL, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!",-1
I really wish I hadn't.,-1
The first few CD's are very entertaining.,1
"There is no real motive behind his evil, and he starts out as a powerful almost indestructible god.",-1
"The widescreen makes the screen seem so much bigger than my old laptop which was also 15.4"" but not widescreen.",1
"If you want to hear Beyonce Knowles at her best, buy any of the three Destiny's Child album, and don't bother with an album that sounds like 40 songs had a car accident.",-1
"Most apply to the US (weather, sports news).",-1
So sad......,-1
Darkness Falls felt like a Tales From The Crypt or an RL Stein's: Goosebumps episode.,1
"The first is the ""string,"" (le fil), a tone that persists throughout the entire record (and beyond, into secret-track land).",1
Netgear software makes me buy them over and over...,1
"First, this is not a 2007 new release, is an old collection of songs from the 70's and the 80's Don't let them fool you with Jose Jose's intros for every song, where he can bearly breath do to his affected voice.",-1
Strengths:Good concept for a very excellent PDA. Had excellent display resolution and color.,1
"On the positive side, Tierney's got a smooth narrative style, and the book might make a nice novel.",1
"The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).",-1
Set-up took 10 minutes and I didn't need support from Slingbox.,1
"The headset itself easily turns on and off (which sounds like a simple function, but wasn't all that easy on my previous two Bluetooths).",1
"Alice digs it too, and this DVD-Audio release is a real treat.",1
Should have some checkpoint at least so that if we kill by boss then we cant rematch again...,-1
"However, I do not recommend this, because the softy in me found myself tearing up on a few occasions and trying to fight back the tears as other people trying to get to work pretended not to notice.",-1
"However the only smart thing was the BDSM-club, a sense of self-awareness, with all the leather and plastic and black, and oh so fetishly dressed actors.",1
"I particularly liked a very early sequence with Rose retreating to the cramped confines of a pale yellow tree house , an envisionment of a metaphorical giantess trapped by her environs (Jack even notices and simply declares ""you're getting to big for me""), attempting to adapt the her Brobdignagian largesse.",1
"While each author may adapt his style a little differently, the content layout remains the same.",1
I accidentally die and GAME OVER... Then i release that my previous save point is far far beyong...,-1
"Of the women Edita Gruberova, as you would expect, gives the overall polished performance, her pure voice ringing out like a bell with never a hint of a screech.",1
He and Susan Isaacs did a great job.,1
I did not like any of the songs.,-1
"What sets this game apart from previous installments is the way it ties Lara's past into the mix, allowing for a slowly unraveling plot to appear.",1
"(although I avoid exercise videos by instructors like this) This is ESPECIALLY out of place in belly dance, however.",-1
It's just rediculous that people would buy this crappy album.,-1
"Finally, the ending smacks of confusion and disappointment never accomplishing anything of merit.",-1
The display is plain manual is quite complex.,-1
"And man, that stylus control just makes you love the DS.Zoo Keeper's basic premise is to line up 3 or more same animals horizontally or vertically.",1
"""Signs"", co-written with Aaliyah's muse Missy Elliot, is a mess of nothing...driveling on about Astrology in a way that is neithor catchy nor creative.",-1
It is really annoying how cheap this and some places take pure luck to beat.,-1
"Similar story with Love of the Common People, the long intro on the album has been shortened, similar as to the single version although I am not sure whether its identical, it is a bit longer than the version on his Time compilation.",-1
It is cool to blow big holes in the side of buildings.,1

"If you get bad position, just START OVER. In fact, let me file that one complaint: starting location in the galaxy (which seems fairly randomized) should not be such a profound determinant to the outcome.",-1
her voice is great in this song 2.Cliche Interlude + Cliche - 5/5 stars.,1
The storyline is flat and uninventive.,-1
The fact that the viewer is dragged thru a lame and less interesting plot from the original sets this movie on a train wreck collision.,-1
"A sound cast of international bravado (Caine as Alfred, the butler, Wayne's manservant/father figure, adds a dash of subtle observations and common sense; Freeman as Wayne Enterprises' best kept secret displaying the varying degrees of know-how and Bat-phenalia; Oldman as a young (soon-to-be Commissioner) Jim Gordon – apparently the only honest cop on the force has a few nice subtle moments of awe and cunning; silky Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane AKA The Scarecrow; Wilkinson as ganglord Carmine Falcone affecting a New Yorkese dialect tuff guy demeanor; Hauer as a reptilian board chairman of Wayne's empire with oily ease); sterling production design by Nathan Crowley envisioning Gotham City as ""New York on steroids"", the dank cinematography by Wally Pfister, and reimagining of the stealthy costumed Caped Crusader by designer Lindy Hemming combine for a robust display of ingenuity.",1

Terrible design.,-1
Wonderful stuff.,1

"BOOGEYMAN (2005) 0* Barry Watson, Emily Deschanel, Skye McCole Bartusiak, Lucy Lawless, Tory Mussett, Robyn Malcolm, Charles Mesure.

You may win one out of ten tries.,-1
"I enjoy extras on DVD, this is so lacking.",-1
"A first-time listener might guess this was an undiscovered gem originating from London, circa 1968. From then on, it becomes a game of ""spot-the-reference"".",1

"It's fast, printer high quality black and whites, and the scan function is fine if you're not doing too many sheets at once.",1

"Overall this is an excellent camera that puts all the functions I wanted (RAW shooting, wide lens, full suite of manual settings and f-stop adjustments) and then some in my back pocket.",1

"I never really felt connected to the main character, and I found myself 150 pages in on the verge of that ever prescient feeling for a reader (do I keep going or drop it), but since it's only about 300 pages long I figured why not keep going.",-1

"Attention to detail is astonishing, from equipment appearing on Lara as you gain it, to the smoke from her guns, everything will leave you breathless.",1
"Neither, I got this with my Game Cube so I did not fall for any traps.",-1
"The DNA option, which updates rosters and player ratings/tendencies to reflect real life NBA performance, is superb, and it really feels like you're playing in the NBA. If you want a great online sports game, grab this, just don't expect EA to get everything right.",1
"The better-than-average film is buoyed by excellent acting by its stars, with Brit Blunt employing an impeccable American accent and making her bitchy 'girl' (as she is only referred to at the credits' close) redeemably likable and Holmes' 'guy' switched back and forth from mensch to menace.",1

Is not that the boss is a sure win situation rite...,-1
I will return this one and gladly pay more to get rid of this crap.,-1
A gem. Buy it.,1

Also might be nice to have relative pointing instead of absolute...,-1
Good job Edios!,1
"Written and directed by Susannah Grant (who makes her directorial debut here) does an able job overall with the usual formulaic expectations: overheard conversations misleading the truth; real-love triumphing; friendship & relationships put to the tests, etc. etc. But the cast makes it a winning diversion and a lot of fun.",1
"Finally, I have to give this game such a low value rating because all you are getting for a $60 game is a single game mode, basic season mode, online play, and create a player...",-1
But it doesn't end here!,1
"First, Bacon decides to get revenge with little preparation.",-1
I left the movie theatre wodering what the hell happened when they were in there?,-1
The web site says their goal is 100% customer satisfaction and thier tech support page actually suggests that you call them but does not list a phone number.,-1
I'm not even going to include the lame cast and simply say the directors : Michael & Peter Spierig should just give it all up and stop while they're behind.,-1
"But the differences are much greater, and so well balanced that you see each faction represented among top players almost equally.",1
** see this on the IMAX and all I can say is : wow!,1
This is one of the best superhero film ever beside spider man 2. I actually found this better than spider man because it was more realistic and didn't look as animated.,1
"Months have passed and apparently Keane has been plagued by his absolute guilt in allowing her to be taken from him that it has affected (or possibly triggered) a panicky, inner voice that speaks to him (or more accurately has him speaking aloud to himself either calming his fear or invoking more paranoia) as he wanders seemingly aimless in the unforgiving way station (a perfect metaphor for his situation), replete with a tattered news clipping about his missing daughter that he waves to unsuspecting passersby and pedestrians alike milling about their daily chores of going back and forth to work or another destination.",1
"Small, but roomy inside.",1
Don't buy under any circumstances.,-1
"But again it is Dillon who gives an Oscar worthy turn as the charming, irritable and barely awake Chinaski that deserves recognition proving there is more to meet the eye in the once –thought-of-one-trick-pony that Dillon was initially perceived for his heavy Brooklyn accent and blank brooding good looks; he does his best work since changing that tune with ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and hope he continues his trek of good fortune unlike Henry Chinaski.",1

As for Jeremy Irons... I don't really want to go there.,-1
"A Three Stooges moment as they pursue a naked husband and wife -- one of whom has a ""perky butt"" -- who are in turn pursuing a dog gives them their sole opportunity to use the guns they have been ogling since book two.",-1
"I recomend this book among others such as ""Collateral Damage"" by Chris Hodges to all those who are inspired by patriotic propaganda to join the armed uniformed services.",1
It's either painfully harsh or just downright boring.,-1
Cons: -Despite the fact the game comes on DVDs you still can't avoid disk swapping at certain parts if you install all the expansions.,-1
I love the assault rifle and the magnum and it was disappointing to see no assault rifle in Halo 2. They also replaced the magnum with a crappier version that is too weak.,1

This album more or less sucks.,-1
"HD tv channels look great, kinda upset that I didn't switch to LCD earlier but also glad because the price is SOOO reasonable.",1
It is almost too simple and lacks preferences or options.,-1
There is even a simple 3x3 grid you can turn on to help you compose in the frame: can't begin to say how useful that is.,1
( Like in any House of the Dead game ) nothing else.,-1
The controls are sloppy and it is hard to be very accurate.,-1
"Anyways, maybe I am just spoiled from Halo and COD4. But it feels like they rushed this game out.",-1
"Also, how many times is Dieselboy going to have mixes of ""Follow the Leader"" and ""You Must Follow"" on his albums.",-1
It also has the cable wrap for your headphone so it won't get into the way while exercising.,1

The site totally sucks.,-1
They're gone.,-1
Much of Rachel Wiess' scenes were shot from so far away it was hard to get into her character.,-1

Anyone can easily tell these are not the original hits.,-1
"Brilliant, loving this.",-1
"Others Escape"" by Underoath, because the song starts slow, seems to be another basic song just like the last two, but at the end Josh adds some screams and it really makes for a pumped up ending to the album.",1
Everyone else should steer clear.,-1
Most authors examine all angles of interpretation through the ages and give a decent bibliography at the end of each chapter.,1

Nichole was the only saving grace to this (simply put) FLOP!!,-1

Billy Preston's tinkling piano and Jerry Portnoy's wonderful harp provide the musical highpoints.,1

"I played this on my friend's 360 and then on my own Playstation 3. (I confess that I'm a Playstation fan -- bought the PS1, PS2, and now the PS3.) The frame rate and color depth on the PS3 version are pretty depressing in comparison to the 360 version.",-1
This does not happen.,-1
I read the book and like it very much.,1
"People lose their last Baby-Tooth every day, but it is never explained in this movie why this Tooth-Fairy hasn't paid deadly visits to others throughout the world.",-1
"But don't get me wrong, the graphics on this game are incredible, I've ran them with a GeForce4 TI 4200 128 mb on high everything it was very impressive.",1
The gore effects are a mixed lot with buckets of viscera for the masses and a hammy – cry for help from Englund as the germ-phobic flamboyant joint owner (!) and porn- star supreme Jameson as the first of the afflicted strippers (!!) You've been warned – although I did like Bach's 'assets' as the busty gung-ho jarhead (and sadly the only one who isn't nude!,-1
There is hardly any new competitive multiplayer content.,-1
i would give this album 9/10,1
I truly believe that the end is near for Patricia.,-1
"Although Blalock is a real hottie, the shameful way her character is depicted as either a 'sista pretending to be white' or vice versea as some sort of living-in-the-shadows- chameleon is only further drummed over the head by the ham-fisted direction by Wayne Beach in his debut as a helmsman and also the film's scribe.",-1
Very cool.,1
The story makes Stargate Atlatis look like Oscar material.,-1
Works wonderfully.,1
I really enjoyed this book.,1
I haven't completed legend mode(defend the belt 7 times) but after that I think it will collect dust.,-1

"Fast, fleet –footed and funny as hell the film runs on all cylinders damn the hard-to-follow loony plottings; who cares - check it out just for the hell of it!",1
The movements of all the characters are smooth and defined.,1
"Although when the two characters finally come together after many bloody, graphic sequences, it is somewhat anti-climatic but the theme of doing the right thing at the right time nearly defeats what has transpired in the first half of this revisionist Western, the best since ""Unforgiven"" and last year's ""The Proposition"".",1
"Maybe this was a bit harsh, but after the grueling hour I spent trying to find quality music in this hip-hop/pop trash, maybe it wasn't punishment enough.",-1
Cons: Guns are weak and inaccurate.,-1
"Tony's blue-collar working class dad, Harold (a superb Rush in a continuing string of chameleon like turns of late), a man who houses many demons and unleashes his inner fury through bottles of beer , tries his best to provide for his sprawling tight family and although his focus on winning-is-the-only-thing-that-matters view in life has to face his failures every day (he gave up a promising attempt as a professional soccer star by marrying young, and regretting every moment thereafter) in spite of his loving family and long-suffering wife Dora (the ethereally haggard Davis equally top-notch in a semi-low-key performance).",1
Take for example Marina and Ridley. They exchange two or three lines and a few significant looks and then BANG!,-1
But I have to agree with the earlier reviewer: don't read it in this edition!,-1
Simply godly.,1
"To make things worse, Tomy added alot of playable characters from the anime in this game, it's too bad all of them play EXACTLY the same.",-1
"But if you are going to copy a movie frame for frame, what is the point of making it?",-1
This makes the game way too easy.,-1
I had a lot of problems with it accepting my DVD disks which play with no problems on my computer's DVD player which I'm sure is a cheaper player by far.,-1
You are not allowed to use the scanner if any single cartridge is empty.,-1
Another bad part is that this bag has no additional zipper to close the main compartment like most other bags do.,-1
"If acting was a draw- back, then understanding what they where talking about was another story.",-1
Because everybody loves microphone games!,-1
Only 5 Stars!!!,1
You must press the button down rather hard before it responds.,-1
"Yes, there are instruments.",1
This game is a very dumbed down version of that game (which also features Naruto as a playable character) you only attack with ONE button making it a easy game to play.,-1
It's actually a very good puzzle game.,1

EVEN IF YOU SEE IT FOR ONLY 2 DOLLARS!,-1
"I was certainly one of the most excited fans out there when I heard this game was going to DS, and the disappointment with all the features they left out of this game was appalling.",-1
You're going to wish you had this when you find it's no longer available; so do yourself a favor and get it now.,1
I wonder how he thought of all that rhymes.,1
"There are two big ""wow"" points here.",1
I do have an issue with noise (especially when it is windy).,-1
And it's a good game to play on a lazy day.The biggest reason I love this game is the fact that the stylus control just works so well.,1
Hearing these tunes in REAL STEREO for the first time is a true revelation.,1
You will be glad you did!,1
Looks good.,1
"The film however falls apart in the climactic final moments, which allows the next film in line to continue the quest for What Happens When We Die; only time will tell.",-1
"I don't mind dealing with pearl scripts, but it wasn't supported and he wouldn't tell me anything about what the script did, so it wasn't that helpful.",-1

No? Didn't think so!,-1
Then good 'ol Kevin escapes the hospital with great ease not to mention heading back to his house and several other places to prepare for his assault on the bad boys lair.,-1
I'm still on the first level but so far I can yell: THERE IS NO ANY PROBLEM WITH THE CAMERA!,1
"Opening with Gideon being shot in the arm and running through the wintry landscape, falling into a freezing river and eventually excising the silver-dollar sized bullet with wincing dexterity, the pace continues to be breathless and anticipatory as Gideon manages to be one-step ahead while Carver's troupe are two-behind.",1
I must by saying Universal Studios is a fantastic theme park but the game just offends it.,-1
"Economic Revolution - A Spiritual Solution by J. Kendall Anderson, M.Ed. [...] With the economy in the tank and President Obama working harder than a Jamaican cook, this book is just what the recession ordered.",1
"To make matters worse, there are different ways to get through the intro screens.",-1
"Best line: ""Heineken?",1
I am returning the unit to the store and looking for a better replacement.,-1
The only good thing is the lead female who is a Russian spy.,1
"Now it seems that many of the vocals are too heavy for the music, and the beat gets lost in the background.",-1

The story was poorly developed and executed.,-1
"Even if this game is so underrated, even if so many people think this game is not really good, I'm going to tell you how this game can be great to play!",1
"One day Keane sees a single mother and child (Ryan and Breslin, both excellent) arguing with the desk clerk over money and he ingratiates himself by offering her a hundred dollars to get her by (earlier he is shown in a near similar sequence) and Lynn and Kira invite him over the next night for a takeout dinner.",1
Why it's the finest beer in the world!,1
"What I found funny about this, is that Ansuya and the other dancers refused to follow her and this point, and continued to dance WITH the rhythm and Kathy is left doing her own thing.",-1
"Perhaps this, one of his best roles to date, will change perspectives overall.",1
I don't really feel for this one.,-1
"You'll often find yourself trapped in a closed arena withhordes of monsters, just needing to find the right combination of Legions (your demonic partners in this game) to kill 'em all and move on.",-1
Sounds more like a rabid poodle on his trail rather than a hellhound!!,-1
"As an avid Koontz fan (that sounds nasty, doesn't it) I enjoyed ""Demon Seed."" I haven't read all his stuff and almost passed this one up because, um, ""Demon Seed""?!?",1
We had to replace the batteries after a weekend of play with the newly purchased book.,-1
Especially not any over 3 years old.,-1
Score 8.9,1
"Filmmaker Lodge Kerrigan has created a truly amazing, deeply felt emotional roller coaster exploring the inner corridors of mental health, family values and the human condition that he touched base on a similar theme in his stunning debut in 1994 with ""CLEAN, SHAVEN"" featuring a schizophrenic (character actor Peter Greene, best known as the racist/rapist doomed Zed in ""PULP FICTION"") attempting to keep his demons at bay in his search for a daughter he never met.",1
"Tongue-thru-cheek T&A and dumb-as-a- stump zombie homage mashup of sub-Cormanian sleaze that frankly hasn't a clever thought in its ripped out skull: a futuristic US government run amok has an experiment gone awry resulting in a horde of zombies with ap*ss and vinegar Marine troop set in for the kill, only to unknowingly transmit the virus at a nearby strip-joint resulting in the titular monster- mish-mash.",-1
"King speaks authoritatively on his subject - as well he should, with volume after volume of best-selling fiction to his credit.",1
For the first 20 minutes.,-1
"Though...After spending some time in a level with pretty much the same exact music, it gets boring...and annoying...and after the whole game, the same tracks are used in atleast four different levels...I think....Maybe it's the same track in every level...",-1
"The fighting is pretty uninventive, unless I totally missed the point.",-1
"How could you not even try do get it to work on my current machine after spending so much time to get all the information out of me, I asked?",-1
There is undeniable chemistry between Garner and Olyphant (who I swear to God if you close your eyes sounds like a rakish Robert Wagner!),1
"And I agree the game should not be easy, but it is almost impossible, which really ruins a game based on stealth.",-1
I must say this camera is AWESOME.,1
The performances are completely polished.,1
It's the execution that makes this game shine.,1
"In his book, he captivates us by telling us what his ""characters"" know how to do.",1
Exactly!,-1
"I really hate to say it, because i think Ani Difranco is awesome, but this album is very bad.",-1
* The book is well researched.,1
But worse than that is the program NEVER completely uninstalled.,-1
It's awful!,-1
Crap! We will of course see the next film in the series.,-1
"Do youself a favor, get your head's out from where ever you all have stuck them and get with the program, either FreeFalcon or Openfalcon for true realisim and performance.",-1
The long build-up given to their anticipated shoot out with Victor Frankenstein is a dead end.,-1
The stupidest quote in this movie was by Sue storm when Von doom says: Let's not fight.,-1
Some explanations seem to be too simplistic.,-1
I do like finally having Cornet on the cover.,1
"The only thing that holds these missions in context is the thin storyline, so it ends up being a mission-based arena game, with the difference that the arena maps are a bit larger than traditional arena games.",-1
That's it for 51 whole events!?,-1
Definitely one of the better tracks on the album.,1
much easier to connect to networks compared to using XP and other software.,1
"So obviously designed for kids, to allow them to shock mummy and daddy, i find it quite sad that 9 blokes decided to adopt this image to sell records.",-1
"His timing is right on the money and Thornton's prickly, misanthropic (and homicidal) Vic is the perfect off-balance to the dicey proceedings at hand causing the two men to wade hip deep in a mire of dead bodies and other unsavory situations.",1
Nice relaxation album.,1
"While it was vivid and layered with parts atop of another, the actors looked washed-out and out of proportion.",-1

Maybe next year or the version for the PS3 will be what Live gamers were expecting from a next generation title.,-1
"The words ""I love you"" have never resonated so much overwhelming emotion that if you are not in tears then you my friend are not human.",1
The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.,1
"The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY, and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window.",-1
Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost.,-1
"""Disappointing"" The overall storyline of the game is held together by poor one-liners.",-1
Customer service though is very good and very responsive.,1
I don't think the creators could have done a worse job and honestly I hope SouthPeak doesn't get the option to make any more games.,-1

This Linksys just didn't want to play.,-1
The result is anything but ordinary.,1
"It is the most original RTS game out there, as it adds in a role playing flavor with the advent of Heroes, special characters each of the races have.",1
Very addictive!,1
No problems what so ever.,1
"Lines like ""It's Latin, it means 'Know thy self'"", screams of un-intelligens, it was of course not Latin but ancient greek since the temple that said it was located in Delphi which is in Greece and not Italy. And no onward to the films.",-1
"Very cool, not that ELP's version isn't great too.",1
Anyway I would advise you to never purchase this game unless you like making bad investments.,-1
"Comeon. I think Dieselboy also should have included ""Submission"" and ""Barrier Breaks"" from the 12"" he did with Kaos. How could he you not include those 2 new, hot tracks on your album??",-1
I would highly recommend this to all.,1
"No....you pay $20,- for 3 hours 'more of the same'.",-1
The recording is wonderfully clean and complete with crystal clear feedback.,1
While the sex scenes are plentiful (thanks Eli!),1
"Downsides are that if you have built-in freeview on your TV, it does get confused sometimes and will refuse to allow you to watch it through either TV or HDD player - I had to mess around with the settings several times to make it stop doing this.",-1
I bought this camera on sale for $399 and hard a really hard time getting good pics out of the camera.,-1

"No soldier in his right mind would scramble to a fence when being fired on, unless it was his last and only place to try and hide.",-1

It even brackets.,1
I love their cd and I love them.,1
She has a good command for her actors allowing each one to shine like the formidably funny and fierce Henson as Petey's vulgar yet golden-hearted hoochie mama.,1

"Eddie Murphy's latest and now this...""Hannibal meets Homer Simpson"".",-1
The real miracle is Lewis who in a perfect world would be a natural bet for a Best Actor nod (and win) but this independent film is small in scale (and distribution so far despite it being executive produced by acclaimed filmmaker Steven Soderbergh).,1

I believe that Lily Burana had good intentions in writing this book but I as the reader sure didn't get it.,-1
Also the media keys are very conveinent when listening to music or watching a movie.,1
In short this book will do more harm than good.,-1
"Let me explain the most annoying part, even more annoying than the repetitiveness.",-1
Told in an icy comic vein by master veteran funnyman Harold Ramis who deftly directs the sordid and humorous sequences with aplomb and some interesting shots along the way (I particularly liked the off-center POV of a shotgun cartridge during one of the climactic action sequences very much so) as well as letting his cast simply let the smart screenplay by vets Richard Russo and Robert Benton sail along in the adaptation of Scott Phillips' Jim Thompsonian pulp fiction with just the right amount of bite and bile executed.,1
"THE LOST CITY (2006) *** Andy Garcia, Ines Sastre, Tomas Milian, Enrique Murciano, Bill Murray, Dustin Hoffman, Millie Perkins, Nestor Carbonell, Steven Bauer, Richard Bradford, Dominik Garcia-Lorido, Julio Oscar Mechosa, Juan Fernandez, Elizabeth Pena, William Marquez, Tony Plana, (Dir: Garcia) Andy Garcia's Bittersweet Valentine To Cuba Andy Garcia has always been a favorite of mine to watch on screen, with his fiery, impassionate no-holds-barred, cool-as-a-cucumber performances with both excessive and implosive turns and his passion is now on full display in his directorial debut, a valentine to his beloved homeland Cuba. Garcia stars as Fico Fellove, a nightclub owner and musician in Havana, circa 1958, on the cusp of the Cuban revolution and a drastic turn of historical events that will forever change his heart and soul.",1
This set of 6 CDs takes the book of the Cosmic Jesus one step further.,1
"The fist boss was Anubus and another was medusa, so the creators just threw in some Greek gods with the Egyptian ones!",-1
"Being a big fan of Nobuo Uematsu, I was overall pleased with his work in this movie.",1
"So with that in mind, you could look at it as one of the ""so bad it's good"" genre, and it does succeed on that level.",1
"But three in a bed make ""country music,"" and it tastes nothing like Bragg or Guthrie--maybe more Wilco than Willie Nelson. What do I mean?",-1
So pick up and read this book.,1
wat the hell !!! So it was a waste of time...,-1
The scares that fail to come are largely due to Roth's build up (finally) after nearly a half hour of lead up with unlikable characters whose sympathy we're supposed to gather by the time they meet their fates with grisly results when in fact the punches are indeed pulled.,-1
The author hasn't even taken the trouble to put up an errata list.,-1

"However, I is a little disappointed about dis movie.",-1
"The only place I found this book lacking was in the ""spiritual content"" department.",-1
If you can gather that this is pure Hollywood hokum formulaic military maverick wanting a chance to redeem himself than don't bother buying a ticket (or wait for the inevitable DVD rental).,-1

This is a very one dimensional book.,-1
It's not all about ME!,-1
This slim book is an interesting quick read.,1
"Lewis, who shined in HBO's mini-series ""BAND OF BROTHERS"" and was the best thing in ""DREAMCATCHER"", a British actor who uncannily channels an American accent every time, is an underrated thespian who truly gives a stunning, shocking and ultimately sympathetic performance.",1
The Good: it's a fun co-op game & SP game (never tried PvP).,1
Because if there ever was a Beyonce album to forget in the dust it's definately this one.,-1

"When I called them to solve this problem, it was horrible.",-1
"You wouldn't see a ballerina or a tap dancer shout out like that in the middle of a number, and I feel that Middle Eastern dance deserves the same respect.",-1

"Newcomer Hamer allows his actors plenty of room in the seemingly improvisatory sequences of dry humor sprinkled out (he co-adapted with Jim Stark, one of the film's producers) and absurd twists to a scene (Dillon's laid-back narration sparks many of the underscored moments of hilarity at hand – ie explaining Jan's shoddy car's lack of functioning headlights only to work when the equally malfunctioning springs to the car in affect bounce them on!)",1
"-Since Baldur's Gate 2 isn't able to check what characters are dead and alive during your playthrough of the first game, if you play through both games you might find characters who you accidentally got beaten to death by a pack of gnolls being A-okay again (and the story of the second game also assumes you had a certain party-setup which you probably didn't).",-1

"The anthropological reputation of Chagnon remains intact, unlike those of anthropologists who have endorsed this dishonest, tabloid-calibre book.",-1
"While it is well acted across the board (Keener, again such a treat as a 'real' woman depicted on screen; warts and all) – including a smallish role by the usual gregariously laid-back Jason Lee as a local greens man who keeps the uptake of the Slavin's demands - it is a showcase for the ethereal Belle (suggesting a love child of Chris Noth and Jennifer Connelly) whose dark quasi-exotic/girl-next-door/angelic being walks a thin tightrope of madness and a desire for 'normalcy' (she even deems Keener's Kathleen as just that 'regular'); she is a propagation of sorts.",1
"If Final Fantasy VII is considered the pinnacle of console RPGs, then Baldur's Gate is most definetely considered the pinnacle of computer RPGs. This is simply one of the best series of games ever made, and any RPG fan simply cannot afford to not play it (and since the whole series is available for a tenner, you don't exactly have an excuse not to do so!)",1

Also NOTE: Software that comes with camera includes BACKWEB - if you are unfamiliar with backweb - it is SPYWARE.,-1
Lead singer Nike Nile's voice just doesn't do it for me.,-1
Any (even just a little experienced) gamer who actually played this game must be disappointed.,-1
"You also have to beat rivals, explore the mountain, complete every extra bonus missions and collect stickers, drawings and dolls of the characters.",1
"Pros: No problems, easy to set up.",1
I believe that it would have been a lot better in black and white like the original.,-1
"Well, simply learning how to adjust a few menu options in the FZ30 and learning when and how to use the appropriate accessories will get you almost the same results with the FZ30 a $500.00 camera as with a $5000. camera.",1
I won't be purchasing from 3ware again.,-1
But in terms of function and ease of use it's very good.,1
What really makes me hard pressed to call this a great movie though is the uninspired dialogue that spans across each character.,-1
"Perhaps I set the bar too high, because I was sorely disappointed.",-1
He also says plenty of wrong stuff.,-1
"Not enough bugs that I wouldn't recommend to buy it, based on the fact that it works fairly well for me.",-1

You can unlock every tournament there is and still you are not finished.,1
"If you can live with that, you WILL enjoy this game!",1
"I easily get 40-50 frames a second on very high in Crysis, and Saints Row pulls an awful 20-27 despite having inferior graphics.",-1
"I really wanted to ""love"" Chaos Legion. It had a lot of the right ingredients for a killer action game - creepy monsters, stylish combos, and lots of frenetic hack-'n'-slash melee fighting.",1
I mean really...,-1
I have played this game up to level 13 so far and I am very impressed with the later level designs.,1
This is a really cool story.,1
The CD book takes those concepts and Douglas-Klotz' scholarship into the realm of the auditory.,1
No warranty on display.,-1

"If ya want emmersion, and overall the highest levels of reality you can get, buy the original Falcon4.0 disk and then go download either FreeFalcon4 from www.freefalcon.com/forums OR Openfalcon 4.5 from: www.f4forums.com/forum The best thing about those 2 sims are 1 - they're free 2 - They're not junk like Falcon4.0 allied Force is.",-1
Could not find any where to put in a claim.,-1
"However, at this point in the game, the draw distances become smaller, and the game looks just about as good as it did on the ps2.",-1
Let me satisfy that curiosity for you - as the service stands - don't waste your money.,-1
Graphics- For N64 is was really good!,1
"it takes a small while to get used to the new style but now i relly love ""fly or die"".",1
Save your money and don't.,-1
This is the worst game I have ever played.,-1

GC is an amazingly difficult game!,1
The ending was disappointing.,-1
"At that point it only holds up as one of those games that's only fun with other people(*cough*Mario Party*cough*). Sadly SSBB eventually loses it's fun factor when it comes to multiplayer, too.",-1
Not one sequence to the next has a cohesive thought or relation to the other is just the beginning of this inept genre flick with some laughable 'creature' f/x to say the least.,-1
"A good idea done right by television standards, and well worth watching for free.",1
factor was crippled by giving away too much too soon.,-1
Miserable to play throughout.,-1
No longer does the music feel constrained by the mono recording.,1
"The lyrics are wry, funny, and thought-provoking, but in my mind are almost completely occluded by the breathtaking arrangements and production.",1
"THE LAST DETAIL (1973) **** Jack Nicholson, Randy Quaid, Otis Young, Carol Kane, Michael Moriarty, Clifton James, Nancy Allen, Gilda Radner. Nicholson is nothing short of brilliant in Hal Ashby's film about two career Navy officers assigned to escort prisoner Quaid to the brig on bogus charges, with some off the beaten trail adventures to make the best of the situation.",1
My husband also loved this book.,1
"Mr. Lieven does an excellent job in his analysis of the Chechen conflict, but readers should use caution against potential bias.",1

"The Bad: As of May 2009, there are still critical bugs left in the game.",-1

"* Each chapter looks to see how we can relate the OT books to the New Testament, specifically to Jesus. * The book is highly readable.",1
So people don t like them cause of that but they are good and their cd is good.,1
It's amazing.,1
"Add in a proven plotline with a long pedigree (Hand that rocks the cradle, Single White Female, many more), some great whacky dialog, and top it off with the inspired idea of a corporate thriller set in a cookie company with the climax in an industrial kitchen, and yeah...I'll bank that.",1
"Let's throw in the fact you have time limits on these assassination missions also, and you get a completely annoying game that is cheap and will aggravate you past the point of reason.",-1
"Then guess what, time to replay the whole segment, but you have to listen and watch the same video and mission start again because there is no skip option.",-1
This is an extremely useful set of CDs for anyone who wishes to develop their spiritual meditative life.,1
"I mean no superstar moves, no dunk contest, where's franchise mode???",-1
"If you like it, by all means buy a paper edition -- but not this one!",-1
"But for what I paid, the camera has worked pretty well.",1
This is just a complete disaster from top to bottom.,-1
"But, the games still have it good points!",1
This game gets dull very fast since you'll find yourself racing one competition event over and over to earn just enough money to buy that extra engine part that you want.,-1
"Like, love or loathe his fiction, you'll find a wealth of solid advice in this little book.",1
"The sound is dated, the structures are boring, the lyrics are juvenile and banal...need I go on?",-1

"I personally would like to blame it on the editing, at the beginning in particular I found myself unable to blink without missing a scene.",-1
"Don't buy it, its a waste of money.",-1
"Along the way he is avoiding his family, namely his wife Lillian (the equally gifted O'Hara) who is requesting a divorce and their teenage daughter Laurel (a great Graynor) whose dabbling into the punk era underscores her dad's rebellious nature in namely a heated affair with Joanna Bourne (a nubile Neuwirth) who is also giving Nicky an ultimatum.",1
Iconoclastic blend of sci-fi and film noir with dazzling set design.,1
This song is so great.,1
"It is at once catchy, hummable and avant-garde.",1
"After researching and comparing this camera (fz30) with others in this price range and higher, I decided to buy the Panasonic DMC FZ30. After two weeks of picture takin' and putting the camera through some of it's many features, (it has features galore!).",1
Sound- Amazing!!!,1
There is no rhyme or reason to the film as it progresses and by the end it doesn't explain anything that has just transpired (or even attempts too!),-1
I also haven't encountered any drops in the game's frame rate.,1
Suddenly its my fault that parts of the program remain.,-1
"When will this stop, when can they put more out of that production-value into the films, it says here in the Trivia-section they spent 2 months working on a raindrop, why couldn't they spend that time re-working the script I ask?",-1
THAT feature is great!,1
If you're a fan of the game you'll be happy to know that the movie recreates it's futuristic world to a tee.,1
This is the worst port I've played in a long time.,-1
"My conclusion is, this is a great book and would benefit any library.",1
"I get home and put the game in my Wii. The first few minutes I was thinking, ""Okay, this is pretty cool.""",1
"You could actually(and this may appall the most devout new age listeners!)consider ""Hyperborea"" 'nature music', for it does indeed transport you to natural locales and states of mind.",1
"I admit the last fifteen minutes make up for the lack of ghoulish could've beens with gusto and self-righteous ""yeah"" paybacks but the trip itself is unsavory.",-1
"It is about a boy named Vivi who doesn't know anything about his past and spends the whole game discovering the exact same things that Terra and Cloud discovered in Final Fantasy 6 and 7. Oh, and Garnet also discovers her past through a series of flashbacks that establish her as something that we the player already knew from the first few hours of playing the game.",-1
Which is why I'm so appalled that she had the audacity to release such an album.,-1
"FACTOTUM (2006) ***1/2 Matt Dillon, Lili Taylor, Marisa Tomei, Fisher Stevens, Didier Flamand, Karen Young, Adrienne Shelly. (Dir: Brent Hamer) Dynamite Dillon excels in Bukowski adaptation Matt Dillon, believe it or not, is one of the more versatile American actors around since his hey-day cocksure anti-heroes of the '80s (""Rumble Fish"", ""The Outsiders"") who can do it all, comedy (""There's Something About Mary"") and drama (""Crash"" which earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination last year) and he continues his journeyman vocation with a humdinger performance running the gamut of human emotions.",1
"The only ones you can interact with are the little harvest sprites, located right under your shed.",-1
"However, it makes one yearn hard for the classic days of PF's heyday.",-1
What I really didnt like about it was that the quests (the large ones) don't end with one dungeon.,-1
No deleted scenes & I had trouble accessing some items.,-1
Then getting into the game itself this type of tediousness continues all over again.,-1
It was becoming too much for EA Sports to take with the annual humiliation from the up-start 2K Sports so they just bought the NFL rights to creating football video games.,-1
...Cons: Gets very hot.,-1
Very disappointing for a game I looked forward too so much.,-1
"Originality: 9/10 It's been a while since there's been a western-like FPS...actually....I can't remember any other...Well there is probably another Western FPS I've played, just this was the most memorable....",1
I think DDO will go the way of all turbine's other MMORG AC2 but allot quicker than AC2 did as AC2 was fun to play at least for a bit.,-1
"I assured him that my front door doesn't know how to write, and that I still had not received my new unit.",-1

Clearly the only goal of this PG horror was to attract children and depart them from their lunch-money by turning a childhood memory into a monster.,-1
"It's very comfortable to charge - the charger is in the socket, the headset is in the charger, no tangling wires - great!",1
The book carries you from the first steps to far into the language.,1
"12X zoom, 8MP, etc.. no need to repeat.",1
"The titles subtext of ""Anti-war classic"" is a bit misleading.",-1
"Johnny is the epic tune that doesn't justify its epic length...Ty's long solo is the most pointless, meandering bunch of swoops and ambient sounds he's ever put together into a single chain.",-1
"It's too bad, but I think most of the people that are going to be persuaded by this book were probably almost there already.",-1
The picture quality is also very good and the main reason I bought it was the upscaling to match my TV - very impressive.,1
The game could essentially pass as a Disney movie.,-1
Note to author: Reading doesn't have to be as painful as a dentist appointment.,-1
"Only some characters can use white magic, some black, some summon, and the rest have their own special attacks.",1
Another issue is the loss of the original design illustrations.,-1
it's exactly as South Park so poignantly described it.,-1
Wil Smith's son just gets a C+ and only because he finally delivered on the closing scenes.,-1
The coaxial cables are integrated directly into the both the antenna and amplifier; you can't just unscrew the cable from either and replace it with something else.,-1
"Some may find that concept hard to buy, especially if they don't even own a pair of boots.",-1
Everything is well colored.,1
I feel like I'm using a really slow computer to play a really graphically enhanced game.,-1
"Filmmaker Hoffman does a yeoman-like job in getting fine quality performances from his gifted ensemble and in his star, Keaton gets a few juicy yet low-key turns as well balancing the tension that is leading to a possible fall-out.",1
"And the ending scene on the train to me, i was thinking, ""that would never ever happen"".",-1
"Because I don't care for country, and because I really do like the quirk in Wilco and Bragg, this album doesn't do much for me.",-1
I look forward to recommending this to my students who enjoy Twilight.,1
"Simple, but addicting.",1
Nice touch.,1
They made a sequel!,-1
"Also, the explosions look great.",1
There are only two scenes that I enjoyed in this entire film.,1
This album is it for 2000!,1
It has a much more modern look and is much more user friendly.,-1
I heard it for the first time when I put the disc in the car player and I was knocked for a loop.,1
Pros: The cover actually has Cornet on it.,1
"If this CD is ""remastered"", it certainly was not from the 1st generation, multi-track session tapes.",-1
"I truly loathed this lame film and hope it doesn't get an audience at all for its attempt to be 'clever' by mixing elements of ""Election"" and ""Rushmore"" (in fact rent those instead!)",-1
"""Check your bargain bin"" The Game play of this game was done very well.",1
However something is decidedly lost in the translation of dysfunctional families in suburbia.,-1
"We have all read books, watched plays or movies of handicapped children who undertake huge tasks and complete them.",-1
they changed all there great songs into bad ballads.,-1
"The bantam actor walks with a dancer's grace, his retro do suggesting a hep cat who is happy with himself in the world, and sharp features blend nicely into his Brad, who feels his edge on things dwindle not unlike Farmiga's Abby, who has the difficult role of a somewhat unsympathetic character (ie a mom incapable of caring for her children to the point of insanity) but acts up a storm in her unorthodox turn.",1
He then takes it to the next step of providing chants for use in meditation.,1
I got it back a couple days later with post-it note hanging out on all sides!,1
"The Bad-Low end PCs can't run next-gen graphics; slightly clunky keyboard controls The Hell?!-Early in the game, you can hear the guards talking about a monkey smoking a cigarette.",-1
there are a LOT of plot holes.,-1
The graphics are not all that great.,-1
I give it 4 out of 5 stars.,1
"Told through interactions of a master and his student, Ishmael presents a view of history in a very different, and for some the real, light.",1
Hookup was easy and after dealing with a few issues caused by norton blocking the connection to the drive we are all good to go.,1

"THE TV SET (2007) *** David Duchovny, Sigourney Weaver, Ioan Gruffudd, Judy Greer, Fran Kranz, Lindsay Sloane, Justine Bateman, Lucy Davis, Willie Garson, MC Gainey, Philip Baker Hall, Andrea Martin. Tart Satire of TV; Duchovny Gives Great Deadpan Jake Kasdan's latest satire, ""THE TV SET"", is a pitch perfect , dead-on depiction of the myopic vision of American television which has become a vast wasteland of so-called 'reality' shows and mean-spirited game shows when in essence, the true pillars of its foundation, the scripted format is on the wane.",1
"This is pure soul--its naked bearing, its deep hurt, its highest joys.",1
"Gone is the wonderfully fat bass line, especially those G's (G1 on your piano keyboard).",-1
The only problem is how the pieces all fall into place relatively with little effort or dismay considering how her fiancée was killed and all and how they come to accept the flaky 'other woman' with barely a ruffle of feathers.,-1
Truly the 24X zoom is superb in replacing expensive long lens of the best quality.,1
"So, if you care about cassette player this stero is very reliable and sounds good too.",1
The lyrics are fun 6.Best Inspiration - 5/5 stars.,1
"And Billy--well, of course, of course.",1
And the sound quality - my God!,-1
Ruining a classic should be against the law.,-1
"Although oppinion, the basis of his oppinions are based in factual information and with anticipated counter aurguements addressed in advanced.",1
"Patricia, please retire with some dignity!",-1
"I reccomend this book to everyone and anyone, especially those who enjoy the great outdoors and animals.",1
Windows support includes a wonderful installer that automatically locates all networked printers and installs the correct drivers for them (which is nice since we have 2 other canon printers in our office: IR1023 and a 4080 with H1 attachment).,1
Everything in between is a bunch of garbage.,-1
Very poor quality and design.,-1
"Belly dance is harder than it looks-and sometimes it takes a while to fully grasp these moves and to do them well-you can't take lessons for one month, and then put out a video.",-1
"If you're looking for *Summerteeth* Wilco or ""Sexuality"" Bragg, this ain't the album to buy.",-1
Rapid fire makes for great pics of birds in flight and sports shots.,1
The voices are done well!,1
I agree with others that the ending seems as tho it was written on the spot when someone lost the rest of the script.,-1
"After haggling with both for several days only to finally find that it was going to cost $125, I was forced to have the credit card company charge-back the purchase.",-1
4. (NB: I am neither a Jew nor an Arab) It sickens me to see the gross racial prejudice of the author.,-1
Keyboard is great for the individual that doesn't what to fool with alternate text entry methods.,1
A body and a voice do not an actor make.,-1
"The production at the time was revolutionary; Lauri Latham (later worked with Echo & the Bunnymen, Squeeze and The Stranglers) came with a distinctive glossy and crisp sound.",1
I couldn't connect with the character the author wanted his readers to connect with.,-1
"Great cut: Hot Summer Day: unique, superb mix of instruments (violin, harmonica, keyboard, and electric guitar), nice vocals (the lyrics are kinda dumb, but that's part of the 60s), fantastic build up...everything that characterizes a great 60s song.",1
The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.,-1
"Not many of the songs grabbed my attention, his voice gets real annoying after a while too.",-1
Trust me...you want someone who DOES. To sum it up...Kathy saw the popularity in the Veena/Neena and Rania bellydance videos-and decided to jump on the bandwagon to make a few bucks.,-1
"It is a collection of pop-happy fluff, filler, and unremarkable songs that simply don't appeal to me at all.",-1
"The set itself is of highly polished architectural splendour and so in keeping with the period of the opera as indeed are the costumes, not exaggerated or over sumptuous and all the better for that.",1
"Compared to the other HM, it's no good.",-1
Highly not recommend it.,-1
But it does comes close if you know what you're doing!,1
"The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.",-1
People will frequently tell me they called and got voice mail but my phone did not ring -- when I try to turn on the phone it won't turn on.,-1
"Final thoughts: If your a die hard Smash Bros. fan, then you'll like this game.",1
I thought it was going to be much better.,-1
"Gameplay - 10/10 If you've played a previous Tomb Raider game, then the outcome is predictable: jumping around, shooting bad guys, and the occasional puzzle and boss fight.",1
"The main problem I have with Potter in the books is that he doesn't really have much say over his life, re-active rather than pro-active.",-1
"And that's what this film is about, nodding to the first film since it now seems a life-time away that these brothers can do something even resembling interesting.",-1
There is a certain magical charm that works between her and Day-Lewis that is both tragic and inspiring.,1
My one complaint is that the slot load cd/dvd drive is very noisy.,-1
But if you want a decent ghost story on a secluded evening check this out.,1
The second thing that sets this game apart is the 4 races.,1
Unbelievably great!!!,1
"So with all this negativity, it looks like I foolishly wasted $30 dollars to get this mediocre game shipped to me, especially already knowing that it lacked.",-1
Awesome eh?,-1
I laughed a bit.,1
"It got better, but not enough to warrant wanting to read the sequel Long Man which just came out.",-1
But 80% of the time you push the button and nothing happens.,-1
Best scene: Jack trying to get Quaid served in a podunk pub.,1
Words cannot describe how bad this movie is.,-1
"You really feel like you have total control over the player, and each superstar plays distinctively different.",1
There was some degree of praise to Jennifer Connelly.,1
This ceedee is the one ceedee that is actually worth paying for.,1
"The graphics are crummy, and despite having crossfired graphics cards (HD4870s).",-1
"The game is jerky, the blood effects are straight outta mortal kombat, combat is so ridiculous that boars and wolves make you their **** But by far the worst part has to be horse riding.",-1
"If I could, I'd give Beethoven's Wig 2 ten or more stars!",1
Actually the phrase “Personal Legend” was used 55 times in this book of 208 pages.,-1
"Score: 10/10 Story - Count Dracula has again arisen: Cornell, a strong man-beast, ventures into Castlevania to find his kidnapped sister and to destroy Dracula.",1
Exactly what soldier did they consult for those great hints?,-1
I'd easily figured out what the puzzle was before turning the page.,-1
It's just lacking something.,-1
"First of all, you do the exact same things through the whole game.",-1
Score: 9/10 Music– In one word: repetitive!!,-1
"The graphics are better and run very smoothly, without a single hitch or framerate problem.",1
they just don't seem to blend as well as I had hoped.,-1
"And the drummer, he is so good, he keeps it in, out, and in the middle of the pocket, and his pork chops, they are so salty, if you licked it you would have to wince.",-1
"But since you can only upgrade your Legions between levels, and it takes such a ridiculous amount of EXP to earn even the most basic of upgrades, it hardly seems worth it in the end.",-1
"Weee. The ATE adds so little to the plot, and takes up so much time, that it seems that Square added them to take up time and disc space.",-1
"Ok first off it seems like my guys top speed is a breath taking 2 mph, 3 mph if I am sprinting.",-1
Spencer gives a remarkably effective performance as the tortured Tony (as does Dellevergin as his younger version) attempting to shake off the waves of abuse and loathing from the only person he so desperately wants to make proud of and is ably supported by a more difficult turn by Draxl (and his younger counterpoint Davidson) as John. The two young brothers are thick and thin covering for each other when things get messy yet eventually a wedge is driven between the two by the conniving Harold who will stop at nothing to see his 'dream' the way it should be.,1
"All of this being said, I appreciate the message of following your dreams in both writings.",1
"Overall, very impressive speakers.",1
"This game is barely worth a rent, because you'll lose interest quick.",-1
"Its got 1696 video memory compared to my Macs 512, a 7200 rpm drive compared to the Macs 5200, both have led screens, but the Macs got 1280 by 800 compared to this which has only 1366 by 768 – though it doesn't seem to matter.",1
"You decide which tournament you want to play, and where you wanna do that.",1
I took it back and got a Harmon/Kardon (AVR-247)for the same price and I feel it blows this one away.,-1
"Um, the guitar player, you can tell he has fat pockets too, and fat licks.",-1
I doubt the producers have ever been to it.,-1
It never came.,-1
"Well i hate to be the only dissenter in an ocean of metal wannabe 12-16yr olds, but this album is an absolute joke.",-1
"The entire Mage counsel building is majestic, and the cotumes and make up are great as well.",1
"It is a collection of meaningless, passionless remixes or pop dance tunes.",-1
Moon's cymbals are transparent...his drumwork really stands out on this release.,1
The spring and winter musics will get on your nerves when you hear them; they're slow!,-1
"Overall, brilliant execution.",1
"Man, this album is soo good i cannot believe!",1
This sort of stop-and-go fighting takes away from the sense of danger that a game like this is supposed to have.,-1
"In this tribute to her son Hill brings the listener to tears and expresses in a few short minutes what soul music is really about--its essence; a mother of music, indeed.",1
The frame rate is stable even through the pace of the game is considarably faster and there are more enemies on your ass at the same time.,1
"Other problems include common clipping issues, buildings and terrain that pops up out of nowhere, and the worst skins I've seen on character models since 2004. The models are sloppy, robotic looking, and frankly ugly.",-1
I've never used a Canon product that felt so shoddy.,-1
"I forgot to mention that weapons in this game are USELESS, don't even bother picking them up.",-1
Unfortunately the game lacks substance.,-1
* The book could stand another 100 pages or so.,-1
I recommend that you keep your money and wait for the really good games this fall.,-1
Pay a few dollars more and get a better bag.,-1
"I doubt if they see just how bad an actor Will Ferrell and how over the top his shenanigans become ""overkill"".",-1
"and glib, self-deprecating wit that acts as a shield from his inner demons his characters often try to keep at bay.",1
"In this day and age of today's advanced digital technology, a golden opportunity to digitally remix and remaster some of the greatest music of the '60s, was missed.",-1
It would be best to get it on cheap rental day at the video store.,-1
Sometimes there are cheap deaths.,-1
"After trying them out, I can only describe them as tedious.",-1
GAMEPLAY 0/10 I would give this a something if I knew how to enter the games!,-1
"The rare gully and stone wall or rock is really your only option for ""real"" cover, but the game more or less expects you to use the haybails to hide behind when a German with an MP40 is shooting at you.",-1
"But director David Von Ancken making his big-screen debut (a TV vet of such shows as ""Numb3rs"" & ""CSI: NY"") – who collaborated on the script with novice Abby Everett Jaques – manages to incorporate some shrewd machinations (a dead horse sequence that actually had me jump out of my seat; kudos to editor Conrad Buff IV) and allow his leads enough space to make the most of their environs (the scenery is a character itself going from the wintry mountains to the arid, no-man's land salt flats) to their advantage.",1
"""OOOOoow!""",-1
No wonder it is getting cheaper by the day.,-1
"This game is NOT the real Ninja Council 3, it's actually the 4th version in Japan. Since this game has no story at all, D3 decided to take Naruto: Saikyou Ninja Daikesshu 4 and modify it to be in line with the American dub of Naruto. If you're fimiliar with the previous versions of Ninja Council, prepare to be disappointed big time.",-1
"Square gave us the ever annoying ''Active Time Event'' (ATE) in this game to give us, the player, and opportunity to see the character interact outside of the party.",-1
No one will ever be able to capture the beauty of Lolita on film and I hope this is the last time they try.,-1
"Of the eight actresses who portray the clueless Aviva, Wilkins stands out as the most memorable if not largely for her zaftig woman-child interpretation with her borderline gargantuan stature (the impression is of a giantess growing in mid-transformation with the sundresses nearly bursting from her ample body) but displays some real emotion in her confusion and dismay at just wanting to be loved and to love someone that makes her few moments on screen so memorable.",1
Controls are intuitively where fingers are placed.,1
"Well, duh, that summarizes just about every bad story ever told.",-1
"The next time a company remakes a game for fans, THEY SHOULD ASK FIRST. BRING IT UP ON MORE FORUMS, WE WILL BE INTERESTED.",-1
"Final Fantasy VII had no plot, and Final Fantasy VIII played like a Jane Austin Novel. Final Fantasy IX regurgitates every possible cliche in history, and draws out these cliches for hours.",-1
"King saves the most harrowing prose for the book's closing chapter, where he describes in detail the accident that almost took his life, and the role his writing has played in his recovery.",1
"Also, it is very similar to DM. Still it is somewhat enjoyable and features a diverse cast (look fast for the black crewman way in the back!)",1
Pros: Fun game play.,1
"Any sensible understanding should begin at the bottom (simple repeated experiments), and Behe does not demonstrate that a non-materialist explanation is necessary.",-1
"It's cool looking, super quiet, and a very small form factor.",1
A good idea done completely wrong and not worth the cash I had to pay to see it.,-1
My T720 has broke down several times.,-1
"The book is short in duration, easy to read, direct in nature, often with an aggitated voice and written as if a sermon or speech.",1
The background are bland.,-1
It's your choice.,1
"On top of this, there are no interesting new revelations about Hudson (or about a Hollywood lavender underworld).",-1
Kerrigan films his troubled protagonist at a too-close-for comfort distance in which the hand-held camera gives the theme and film a scary immediacy ; you want to root for Keane but not get that close to the turmoil broiling inside.,1
You are unable to check a log or bread crumb pattern.,-1
There are many characters to choose from and almost as many fighting styles.,1
Many details and explanations are left out.,-1
I could have purchased a sub $100 card and received better results.,-1
"However, Mercs 2 was fun, and I did enjoy it.",1
This cd was horrible.,-1
2. The pictures are amazingly clear.,1
"A lot of action movies have the unbelievability factor, but for me, i actually found myself thinking how bull***** this movie was.",-1
Garcia does an admirable job in capturing the flavor of the late 1950s look of the imbroglio-to-be with an elegant production design created by Waldemar Kalinowski and gorgeous cinematography by Emmanuel Kadosh that does justice to his ideal yet struggling nation under fire.,1
I found Kathy's overall attitude about belly dance appalling.,-1
"However, Mr. Lieven does provide a fascinating insight into the war.",1
Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get a great LCD for a low price.,1
I still give it 3 stars because the music itself is good if not great.,1
Thinking that if u go fight the boss without any saving...,-1
This is the worst VH album of all time.,-1
The game play is incredible for two reasons.,1
I was highly disapointed with this game.,-1
"The arenas, player models, crowds, coaches, lighting, and presentation are all the best I've ever seen in a basketball game.",1
This is good too!!,1
"Story - 8.5/10 As before, you have to raid tombs (hence the name), gaining the artifact inside.",1
Twists that just don't click.,-1
"12. The End - 4/5stars Starts out slow then picks up, sounds nice.",1
"If the tour visits your city, don't miss it.",1
"In truth, I was expecting a lot more than what I got in terms of graphics.",-1
"Cliche, Best Inspiration and Evolution are my favorites.",1
"The Bottom Line: Buy this camera, and if you haven't taken a decent picture before, this will make you look like a pro!",1
This gives the record a real organic feeling: it doesn't sound as if it was spit out of a hit factory.,1
I think that he has more rhyming words than the rhyming dictionary.He also draw great pictures that really describe the scene in the book.,1
"I've heard them better, but far away from good.",-1
"If you needed to lengthen the coaxial cable, you could use a female-to-female barrel connector, but I assume you would start degrading your signal at some point.",-1
it was loud and incomparable.,-1
"I thought at first maybe I had a defective version of the book but after reading other reviews, I see that our problem is normal.",-1
The songs really never come to life.,-1
"If you did happen to see these both, you may at least recognize some of the actors in the first one, however this movie only was supplied with some of the worst.",-1
Don't buy or rent this DVD,-1
"The whole ''the crystals are back thing'' sounded nice...except that you don't bother with crystals until disc 3! The characters were beyond cliche, beyond trite, they were flat, like cardboard cut outs, or movie extras.",-1
"Another thing is the US version of this game is missing 8 characters, a few jutsu's and 1 stage.",-1
"Besides it runs many google apps, and Apple has too many garbage apps that are just worthless.",1
"Controls - 9/10 Although keyboard controls are a bit clunky, a 10$ PS2-style gamepad will fix this right up.",1
To get the story he drops into whaling expeditions and arctic research explorations with equal aplomb by chipping in and becoming one of the team.,1
The story didn't seem to be very original.,-1
Riiight.,-1
The story was weak and beaten to death.,-1
"""All flash, no substance"" Features -All skill-requiring mini-games have been removed!",-1
It made me fall asleep the first night after using it.,1
"Value Seems very long, but the campain can get a bit boring, those videos really get on your nerves aswell.",-1
"If you are looking for a game buy Star Fox Adventures or Mario Party 6, not this.",-1
"I saw Brad at the Oprey way back when, and I must say I knew he would be a star, but this album is sooo lack-luster, very disappointing.",-1
They should have just re-released the original.,-1
People I've been talking to were always complaining about low volume (they had it maxed on their receivers) and strange rustling and swishing noise.,-1
"during the climactic climb atop The Bradbury Building, as well as his improvised ""like tears in rain"" speech which always gets me.",1
Anata is one of those rare bands that hasn't yet written a bad song.,1
Both have great displays.,1
"If you want a fast paced, fun, exciting, and non-repetitive game, then get Burnout 2 or Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2. These two games have a lot more different game modes that will keep you busy for hours while your Gran Turismo 3 sits on the shelf.",-1
Sykes steals the show as Evan's sarcastic assistant.,1
I was really enjoying that style of writing.,1
The film slowly led into some elaborate heist of some sword which was worth a lot of money.,-1
The material is durable and the bag looks good.,1
Zidane is a girl crazy teen who's idealistic immaturity is as boring as his one line pickups.,-1
The other flaw is the level design.,-1
"In my own opinion, this release and Wings' VENUS & MARS are DTS' worst 5.1 CDs on the market.",-1
The Aiming feature has yet to be desired however.,-1
Lucas? If your listening....Go back and watch your own original #4. There the characters were fun and their interaction was great.,-1
The 8 man tournament possible warrants this purchase.,1
"Thomas Allen is a singer I greatly admire - however on this night he just doesn't seem vocally up to the challenge, his aria `Fin ch'han dal vino' Is taken so fast by Muti that he is breathless and seems unable to cope, by the end of the opera he is evidently flagging.",-1
"but the moive has it's high points, the CGI is great and the Dragon fights were amazing.",1
"No, of course not!",1
"Yes, she replied curtly and hung up.",-1
"If you like the Who and have a CD player capable of playing NON-HYBRID SACDs, then this one is a no-brainer.",1
"Many of Frymire's conclusions are naive, and a large number are just plain wrong as will be obvious to any creationists.",-1
"They each have their roles, and the ways they interact with their allies and opponents is a large part of the game.",1
"The village still exists, of course, but you can only go shopping there: the shopkeepers are only “pictures”, not persons, and you can't move around in the shop.",-1
the cure song is total rubbish...,-1
"perhaps the reason robert smith had to do the song all by his lonesome: the other members openly hate DM... in fact, even smith has made it a habit to rip on DM for many years...",-1
"When you are sitting watching an action film and the only thing you can think of is, 'Well, at least a lot of stuntmen got work', there is something wrong with the film.",-1

"Proving it takes two-to-tango, Neeson is at his most subtle yet still a looming presence with his brawn and stalwartness bellies his real intent: revenge at any price.",1
"To make matters worse he runs into an old colleague, Elliot Litvak (an unkempt and funny Dunne) who is downward spiraling fast after a devastating debacle in the form of his last attempt at a play that was skewered by the hated Schwimmer to the point Litvak can quote chapter and verse of the bilious critique that has him fixated to the extent of dementia.",1
The issue is the online interface.,-1
I am very impressed with the quality of the playback.,1
"-100+ hours of pure RPG bliss, with an epic storyline to match.",1

Story The plot is what really kept me fromlosing hope of this game.,1
"Just when you think you got it figured out, you will get hit upside the head, or start a game with tougher enemies that just kill you.",-1
"Even a little child will take beautiful pictures with this camera if he/she is able to set it to AUTO. But like all electronic equipment, (LCD, HDTV, TV monitors, and digcams), you have to adjust the controls (PICT.ADJ) to get the best picture, or a picture set to your personal preference; you know-contrast, brightness, sharpness, etc... well, the FZ30 has controls that when adjusted properly, practically eliminates the so called 'noise' problem.",1
... Weaknesses:Very poor wi-fi range.,-1
"THE ICE HARVEST (2005) *** John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Platt, Randy Quaid, Mike Starr. Black Comedy For Those Not In The Holiday Spirit John Cusack has always been one of the few actors who merit the Gold Standard when it comes to watching a film for pure entertainment and he excels with his good-hearted average guy manner in an unlikely dark comedy with another actor who is also in the same league of criteria, Billy Bob Thrornton (both co-starred in 1999's ""Pushing Tin"" a sort of satirical comedy about air traffic controllers at each other's throats) and together they make a fine comic duo.",1
She still looked hot though.,1

"Makes the headset easy to carry along with cellphone, without throwing it in my purse and accidentally having it turn on and call back the last number dialed.",1
"And though the book puts great emphasis on mathematics and even includes a big section on important mathematical background knowledge, it contains to many errors in the mathematical formulas, so they are of little use.",-1
"The albums opus is ""Sea Map"", which straddles some nether-ground between Led Zeppelin, Bardo Pond and Porcupine Tree. This is balanced by the delicate beauty of ""Scrapbook of Madness"" and ""Satellite Sun"".",1
I believe that most readers would have rather read about Vincentes experience in nuclear power plants with all its technical complexity than being bored by his fabricated and dull pump system.,-1
"However, in my opinion a book's value is not in merely restating what has already been written, but in the creative contributions to and interpretations of what already is.",-1
The fact he actually shows a real-life chameleon during several sequences involving Nora is truly eye rolling.,-1
Yet the screenplay by Anthony Fingleton - based on his biography with his younger sister Diane – keeps the storyline real in its brutality and shame.,1

"Enter equally unlikely meet-cute Harmony Faith Lane (the luscious Monahan, who makes a sexy funny performance cook to perfection) a childhood friend from Harry's past who shows up at a party that both Harry and Perry are attending for Shaw. Seems Lane has always pursued her dream to be an actress and ever since they were kids playing magician and assistant (guess who and guess who) she came to La-La-Land with little fanfare and a broken heart.",1

"But the headset is huge - it doesnt fit into my ears - none of them, and believe me - both of my ears are of generous size!",-1
It is an adventurous game that provides lots of gameplay and excellent graphics Gamplay- Amazing!,1
"The games are too quest based and if the rides were just rides then, it may have received a six or even a seven, but the gameplay stopped it from getting a 4. OVERALL 3/10 This game is amazingly unique, but the gameplay, graphics, music and sound effects ruin it.",-1
I expected the unit to far surpass my computer's DVD player and it doesn't.,-1
Took away game play settings.,-1
"None of these factor into his character however, and we are left with a thief so lifeless and boring that we wonder what all these love sick girls see in him.",-1

I wish that NIS America had done more polls to fans to ask what we wanted.,-1
"Yes, I do think they are way better in this game than NBA 2k6 for the 360. The reason I feel this way is because the textures used for the skin look a lot better, have more color, and the sweat graphics look more realistic.",1
It just makes sense.,1
The mans voice on the cd isn't very soothing.,-1

"For instance, there is a small whole where the earpiece of the phone is suppose to line up.",-1
"So I tried a couple other stores in the area, still no luck.",-1
Cons: Horrible quality.,-1
What I didn't like about this game was that the last level was just like the first.,-1
"And after all these years, we STILL get ""Mexican Shuffle"" in MONO!",-1
But personally I much prefer the writing of LM Montgomery over Paulo Coelho. I didn't come to love the characters in “The Alchemist” as I did the characters from Avonlea.,-1
"Enemies get frozen in space, stuck in doorways, etc... It's so bad it's amateurish.",-1
"I was outraged at the reviews and acclaim it has recieved, so much so that I decided to write my first review.",-1
"The only reason I give it a 1 is because of the graphics, just as another review stated: terrible game with nice coat of paint to hide it's rust.",-1

(Dir: Kasi Lemmons) Cheadle Sparkles in Biopic Don Cheadle is perhaps the most underrated best actor of his generation giving it all in every film performance and not getting the true props and recognition for his craft of versatility.",1
"Clear instructions, realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material, but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately won't impress.",-1
"There was no emotion, they all sounded exactly the same: bland, dull, and over-polished.",-1
"Since he is a thief, why not make him more devious.",-1
Pros: The picture and sound.,1
"The soundstage has gotten wider and the sound, more detailed; quite unbelievable considering the narrow profile of the speakers.",1
The battery also lasts 4 hours on power saver mode!,1
"It's okay for a short film or small part in a film, but a whole feature?",-1
Pros: Works excellent in my Dell 8100 using XP Home. My wireless router is in the basement and it works fantastic everywhere in my house (no dead spots even on 2nd story).,1
"The one song Beyonce seems to want to make a big deal about is ""Dangerously In Love"", a remake of the enchanting love Ballad first performed by Beyonce's girl group, Destiny's Child. This, I wouldn't have a problem with if it were a remake at all, instead of an exact replica.",-1
I encourage you to buy this cd....my copy is available.,-1
It also very exciting to kids 3-6 years old.,1
"But then the song breaks down into a bass-led melody, with Schalin at first almost speaking the lyrics, then screaming over the soft music.",1
It's one of the few shooters I've ever played where I was hoping the game would end sooner.,-1
Why the alien has arrived and why the earth is in peril is a slap in the face compared to the classic motive set forth in the original.,-1
"Regardless, the author proposes several solid ideas to remove the economic incentives out of war and create policies which deny officials the coercive practices and threatening posturing of military forces against other foriegn governments for other than national defense (which said practices are used for economic coercion).",1
"Don't waste your money and try to play this game on the PC. It will frustrate you, anger you, and make you want to chuck the game in the trash.",-1
"The location of the flash is unfortunate in that it pops into left my hand as I try to shoot...the only other hand-hold would seem to be cupping the body from below, or shooting one-handed.",-1
"The graphics don't do this game justice, either.",-1
Makes it tough for use in a mixed environment.,-1
"Just to throw out a few examples of this-when Kathy was leading clockwise chest circles in the slow segment (lifting the chest up, to one side, down, then to the other side) she was letting her chest collapse to center between each move rather than holding it there.",-1
On disc one you have the beautiful vocals of Barbara Tucker with 'Beautiful People'.,1
Pros: this is a very attractive sportband.,1
Square's ''old school'' attempts went to waste since there really wasn't anything ''old school'' about this game--not plot wise anyway.,-1
"This orriginal album shows alot of talent and includes a number of styles of music, So it suits everyones taste in music from hiphop to rock.",1
We have to zig-align the camera so the film (actually BL scan back) and the plane of the art are aligned exactly.,1
"SLOW BURN (2007) * Ray Liotta, LL Cool J, Mekhi Phifer, Jolene Blalock, Guy Torry, Taye Diggs, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Bruce McGill. More like a simmering potboiler: 1995's crackling neo-noir sleeper ""The Usual Suspects"" was in a class by itself but lately there have been some numerous copycats in attempting to glean some magic from its infamous twisted ending revealing who its arch-criminal Keyser Soze really was.",-1
"Lastly, I felt betrayed by the ending that left questions unanswered.",-1
Wohlforth cheerfully tackles the deep fog of climate science (even some of the career scientists he interviews seem hopelessly befuddled by the complexity of it).,1
"Especially the shopkeepers, they're very well designed when you see them in the shops.",1
utterly disappointing.,-1
On this one they're just depressed.,-1
"Also, it seems more than a little condescending to say that certain Hindus weren't really vegetarian because of the insect parts contaminating their flour.",-1
"10/10 Controls: You'll find yourself mostly using the stylus for this game, by throwing things, rubbing your stylus on your dog's head to pet them, and showing them how to do tricks.",1
"Back to the I-trigues; the more I listened to them, the better they started to sound.",1
I threw away the cd after listening to 2 songs.,-1
You can barely hit guys across the streets with a M4. Racing missions are just annoying.,-1
"The auto-fit option flattens standard photos quite a lot, while the other options leave space on either side of the photo.",-1
"moment as I found something that related both to business practices, and my personal relationships.",1
"The band that goes around the back of your head is not adjustable, and if you are wearing a collar of any sort, when you move your head at all, it will rub and move the ear buds in and out of your ears.",-1
Re-playability 1/5 After the credits the only thing to do is a few side-quests that only help with bragging rights.,-1
"Farro's guitar in this song is impressive and incredibly catchy, showing that this band will probably be hanging around the scene for awhile.",1
The relationship between Michael (the main character) and Angela (a complete stranger he hops into bed with in the first chapter) is not only unplausable and mesogenistic it reads like the fantastic pipe-dream of a teenage boy.,-1
however dispite this the album is still fantastic and contains the Original NERD flavor.,1
"Overall, the effort put into this games plot must have been minimal, making the game highly unmemorable.",-1
"Personally, I don't think they should make horror films that are rated either PG or PG-13. What sort of audience are they trying to appeal to when they green-light a slasher with zero gore?",-1
"It was cheaper than to get one without) It is also very noisy and performs random updates in the night, which can be annoying.",-1
"This is what gives Harvest Moon games a little something special, and they took it all off!",-1
I think it should be read by any serious Bible student as well as any casual Bible reader.,1
"On the plus side, there are buttons to program for radio stations and this is done like in the car.",1
They are so great and they give Atlanta a good reputation.,1
Extremely bland performance from Eddie (three note riff on Don't Tell Me?),-1
"The book tells one how to ""get paid"" in a spiritual way.",1
Notice that I gave the film 6 stars and thats because it was a masterpiece in so many ways.,1
Better than most FPS (exception; BLOOD!),1
I think a large majority of the effect was lost in making this movie in color.,-1
"It works, but it freezes the picture for about 3-4 seconds before starting over which, again, my computer's DVD player does seamlessly.",-1
"The most ""exciting"" scene of the movie dragged out for what seemed to be hours.",-1
"After a violent start, the story develops at a more livable pace, building the characters and events to climax in the Hero's gut-wrenching search for the Heroine and their daughter, both kidnaped by the sadistic, murdering Rapist. SHANGHAIED HEART's setting and plot give the reader an intimate glimpse of that era in rural life, as well as bringing home what it's like to endure racial discrimination.",1
"You have say ''hit points'' for each weapon, for example: You equip a sword, and it can only be used 15 times before breaking.",-1
"Unfortunately, Assassins Creed failed with me also.",-1
"Also, did you hear of anyone called Orik or Hothgar in the movie?",-1
Seems like everyone is getting these issues.,-1
"Most of the other songs are saddled with sludgy, over-reverential takes that lack soul and life.",-1
-Choose your character's allignment (from 'goody-goody two shoes' to 'completely neutral' to 'murderous lunatic'.,1
"Beyonce, you're incredible, but this album was a slap in the face to all of your fans and anyone who even mildly liked you.",-1
"I don't know, I think he still is pretty putrid.",-1
The first thing I noticed was that Kathy can't keep a rhythm and you cannot properly execute most of the moves-so it was a bad idea to have her lead this video.,-1
"What?!? Come on, that was ridiculous.",-1
"It's cheesy, 1980s pop-rock that is barely saved by the fact that it being played by a band with incredible execution.",-1
"Actually I really like this movie, even just watching it straight.",1
What I've learned now is...Don't get your hopes up.,-1
What a waste of celluloid but wait!!,-1
Read it.,1
"I hear they are releasing new modes, but who cares when the game play is this bad.",-1
The film is worth a look at to see how one can find their happiness even if it comes with little burden.,1
It held the promise of leading off into a sci-fi novel but didn't quite reach anything beyond the mundane until the last couple of chapters of the book.,-1
"That said, this album is very poor.",-1
Graphics Abseloutly amazing.,1
"Listening to some movie soundtrack remixes!""",-1
The problem is this router doesn't really support Apple Macs. My previous router/modems (Speedtouch and Netgear wired) were literally plug and play.,1
Very expensive compared to others.,-1
"Halo has a creative plot, some interesting sets, cool weapons and aliens.",1
His latest is no exception.,1
3. The level of manipulation on the emotional and historical level that the author attempts is flat out insulting to the reader.,-1
"The first is the Artificial Intelligence, which is amazing.",1
"Beginning with slow, chugging riffs, it is after the first verse that it kicks into high gear, harmonies running rampant.",1
This fantastic cd is a (((must have))) for everyones cd collections weither they are a big fan of NERD or not.,1
For this reason I'd put off installing the expansions until you're at a point when you can make use of the expansion content (basically end-game or when you reach the experience-cap).,-1
Keep an eye on this naturally gifted young actress.,1
"Castlevania really looks like an old castle, and your characters are really well-designed.",1
Wow. What a concept.,-1
No story.,-1
This song is SO GOOD. Possibly my favorite song on the album along with Cliche 7. Ain't Home Tonight - 4/5 stars.,1
"While I read the book from cover-to-cover, it would work best as a resource for anyone studying the OT. Kevin Vanhoozer sets the tone of the book early by writing a masterful introduction.",1
"As it is, I consider this bag as no good even for the beginning amateur.",-1
"With a proper dictionary like Payne Smith's Compendious Syriac Dictionary there is little else you need for classical Syriac. Beginning with the script and pronunciation it advances through pronouns, nouns and verbs in a very orderly fashion.",1
"I also thought the fallen angel story was really neat, and I wanted more of it.",1
These chants are accompanied by modern but appropriate guitar music and enable the listener/participator to enter more sensually into the original language.,1
"It really felt to me like Kathy was in ""aerobics class"" persona, just wearing a fancy costume.",-1
"It's a classic Edith Piaf song, but this interpretation marries all of Karin Clercq's best qualities in one track: a beautifully alto voice, incredibly clear diction, and a gorgeous Belgian accent.",1
"I endured the boring pre-heist moments, expecting a good final scene.",-1
"The trouble is that ""Book 1: Production"", is missing completely.",-1
Now let's talk about the flaws.,-1
Dungeons in this game are EXTREMELY short and only take long because of the random encounter every step and a half.,-1
"The song, ""To Zion,"" merits owning the album alone.",1
Original character expressions replaced with medicore digital drawings.,-1
"Behe has said that if scientists were to discover some non-materialist phenomena, they would keep that discovery a secret!",-1
"Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.",1
The Villian is a total rehash of FF6 and FF7. His character is pointless and arbitrary to the game as a whole.,-1
I also noticed a marked slowdown on the machine with the active backup software monitoring in the background.,-1
STAY AWAY FROM TWO WORLDS...DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!!!,-1
And that's why I could not enjoy this novel more.,-1
"When the station would change from commercials to shows or vise versa, the sound would cut out on some.",-1
"If it's going to lock up that much, at least they should make the reset button more easily accessible.",-1
My real rating is -5 stars.,-1
Visionary film-making at its best.,1
"Building on known technics he refined and combined them to form a coherent framework that guides you from the first assessment to the final delivery, putting emphasis on the 'get it right the first time' principle.",1
"That being said, NBA Live 10 is fan-freakin-tastic!",1
I don't know from day to day if it will work or not.,-1
"However, in sunny VZ, the game looks nice.",1
It is very much like the way the 51' movie portrayed them.,-1
"Then, get a group of people together to pull money to 'share the pain'.",-1
My friend got the soundtrack and i borrowed it and found that there were lots of tracks missing...,-1
It's like NBA Live without serveral of the features that make Live such a fun bball series.,-1
"I have been able to take more than 30 pictures with a fully charged pair of batteries before they went dead, and it is simple to just carry a spare pair of batteries for backup, as the battery charger that came with the camera accommodates 4 batteries.",1
The gift of gab has never been so enjoyable.,1
"Koontz finds his footing in the final chapters, a Lovecraftian showdown between Frankenstein and his artificial creations inside a series of tunnels beneath a dump.",1
"Whatever the season, the music, you will get sick to hear it, so take off the sound on your Gameboy, choose one of your favourite songs, find a CD player and enjoy good music while playing the game!",-1
If I could return it and get a refund I would.,-1
"Not perfect graphics, but extremely good graphics!",1
"manufactured anger, for a manufactured audience.",-1
"BATMAN BEGINS (2005) **** Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, Mark Boone Junior, Linus Roache. Excellent prequel 'origin' of The Dark Knight that adds fresh blood to a weakened franchise thanks largely to the unlikely POW!",1
"The pictures had no color, were not sharp, and terrible DOF. I probably could have been able to eventually use it to its fullest potential but I want good photos now.",-1
"Pros: For the most part, a very decent printer.",1
There is enough room to store my whole music collection plus many photos.,1
"After hundreds of pictures and a week of giving it every chance to prove itself, I gave up.",-1
There's just nothing to do at a lot of the places.,-1
"It's like the teams in Sonic Heroes, only the system works better.",1
"It won't taste nice, and its a bore.",-1
Downey makes an affective coward/jerk/good-hearted schnook while Kilmer coasts on his pretty boy charms with a nod to straight men like Bud Abbott and Dean Martin – street smarts and flair to spare.,1
"Second, he goes from a bundled up neurotic basket-case white collar worker and then becomes ""Jason Bourne."" Third, if that isn't enough, the bad guy thugs shoot him and obviously everyone in the theater can see he's only winged and ""they"" leave him while exiting the house with nary a cop in sight while a patrol car sits out front with two murdered officers leaning on a horn blaring away.",-1
"Those are good, and they won't bother you before a long time.",1
"If your not, then you won't.",-1
"Honestly, this album should be avoided by anyone except collectors.",-1
"With 5-6 different tunes in the game, that you keep hearing over…and over…and…………over!!",-1
"I called Sony again, and again the first agent said it was already sent, then after I explained it hadn't arrived I was transferred to the second department, which again confirmed it hadn't been sent out yet.",-1
"-ing and shouting...and yelling ""Yeah!""",-1
It was terrible.,-1
"...but ""A Night at the Opera"" just doesn't do it for me.",-1
Both make you feel for their desperation and ultimately their last-ditch efforts of keeping their sanities in lock-step.,1
"I am looking forward to trying out GC2, but from the reviews, it seems that the major enhancement is the ability to design ships.",1
Let me substantiate my claim: 1. It is historically inaccurate.,-1
"The choreography in these scenes doesn't lend itself well to physics either, where barriers such as gravity and an individual's physical strength are breakable at the character's convenience.",-1
After reading Blow fly I doubt that I will ever buy another.,-1
"I thus give it only three stars, which may be generous.",-1
"If you can surmount that disappointment, it should be noted that the studio clips are mostly of extremely poor quality (as if photographed from a tv screen).",-1
Simply amazing.,1
"However as an adult, I don't get why so many adults like this series.",-1
"The lyrics of Commissioned gets a 5 star rating because they didn't compromise their message with the world, their message was design to uplift your spirit so I must say thank you Commissioned for being a part of my childhood life, your music lives on and on!!",1
The ending offers some conclusion to the divides within her family and we see that life continues on.,1
"The delicate, vine-laden garden lattice of ""Unfold"" has been replaced by a hard, brick wall of sound this time out.",-1
The normal graphics are good too.,1
* I wish there would have been more talk of the archaeological records.,-1
Frymire is appallingly ignorant of the creationism movement and this fact shows on almost every page.,-1
"The album versions from the album were, however, nowhere to be found.",-1
"The major drawback to the game is actually one of the simpler things: You are forced to use bulletproof wooden fences (huh?), haybails, and tin barrels as legitimate cover for yourself and your squad.",-1
Extra features after game play.,1
"This is probably true for other cameras, but with the Gateway camera it is particularly troublesome because the shutter button seems to lack sensitivity.",-1
"I'm sorry, but somebody with a pocket camera is NOT going to be carrying around a tripod to make sure their pics aren't blurry.",-1
Electrifying Nicholson!,1
Raw and devilishly good with some insight of anger in males in all of cinema.,1
There are also equal amounts of chemistry between the trio of male friends who are all looking out for the best interests of Garner's character (as well as their own well-meaning agendas overall without being creepy or downright chauvinistic).,1
UNDEAD (2005) 0 * Arguably one of the worst films I've ever seen – nonsensical hodgepodge about a meteorite shower causing an Australian fishing village to become zombies with it's so-sure-of-itself-smugness incorporating (ok --- Stealing!,-1
The software they provide is pretty...,1
The band sounds bored silly on this album and it shows.,-1
"Score: 5.5/10 Graphics- Not bad, in fact, I'd say they're pretty good.",1
"The song picks up again with more heart-wrenching harmonies, screams and pounding drums.",1
None of the songs stand out from each other.,-1

"But then you have the ""Lola"" who looks like a man and the love between Darius Stone and Lola is sooo unbelievable.",-1
"The game play is annoying, repetitive, and stupidly hard.",-1
I feel like a different voice should have been used though.,-1
"Some require pushing A, others you have to select options with the cursor then click A, others require jumping to get a random dice roll.",-1
"First the good news...the camera takes nice, sharp pictures when zoom is not used and there is good lighting; it is compact and lightweight; and it is the most inexpensive camera I've seen with both digital and optical zoom and 4 megapixels.",1
But regardless of how hard I pushed the iPhone down it won't go any further leaving the top of the phone exposed and earpiece unalligned.,-1
"Black's sharp, skewered and outrageous humor percolates like a heady witches' brew of goofy insouciance effortlessly in the hardboiled tradition of Raymond Chandler which he spoofs with the wry narration Downey does throughout and upending the apple cart of the pulpy fiction noir genre with gleeful gusto.",1
"Finally, it's no surprise that Hutton and Platt both turn in performances that are well worth watching.",1
"I previously posted the following review of this player: ""My Sony D500P arrived yesterday, and I tried two different DVDs, but both played poorly.",-1
"Actors struggle to find the right emotions scene after scene and confused me more than once, while the script is filled with a lot of nonsensical ""going no where"" hubbub.",-1
Fox...shame on you.,-1
"You basically have spells and weapons, then hack and slash your way through the enemies to the bosses.",-1
"But the Oh, my gosh!",-1
But those two scenes are not worth the quarter that the Tooth Fairy leaves beneath your child's pillow.,-1
"I never felt bad once for Amir, but I loathed him even to the end.",-1
You can customize this character in many outrageous ways.,1
This makes the game even scarier.,1
